# Regenerate analysis + generation artifacts when source code is newer than
# their checkpoint outputs. Used as the work-phase bootstrap hook to
# prevent the stale-checkpoint failure mode where a downstream task forms
# fix hypotheses against artifacts produced by an older source revision.
#
# Freshness rule per stage: regen iff the newest mtime among the stage's
# inputs (source code + upstream checkpoint) is strictly greater than the
# oldest mtime among the stage's outputs. Catches both source edits and
# upstream drift (fresh `collected/` above stale `enriched/` is the
# canonical case).
#
# Stages:
#   1. analyze: inputs are analysis/crates/{datalog,resolve,annotate,enrich}/src
#               + collection/ir/collected. Output: analysis/ir/enriched.
#               LLM annotations in analysis/ir/annotated/*.llm.json are
#               preserved across reruns by load_existing_annotations() as
#               long as --llm-dir is omitted.
#   2. generate: inputs are generation/crates/emit{,-*}/src
#                + analysis/ir/enriched. Output: generation/targets/{lang}/
#                generated. Runs all registered emitters by default.
#
# Collection (cargo run -p apianyware-macos-collect) is intentionally not
# regenerated here: it costs ~2 minutes and is gated on SDK header changes
# rather than source code changes, which is a manual decision.
#
# Usage:
#   ./analysis/scripts/regenerate-stale-pipeline.sh           # all targets
#   ./analysis/scripts/regenerate-stale-pipeline.sh --lang racket-oo
#
# Exits non-zero on any cargo failure so a calling work-phase hook can
# abort the cycle before launching claude.

# We use newest-vs-newest, not newest-vs-oldest, because the generator
# does not necessarily touch every file in its output tree on every run.
# Files emitted by an earlier generator version that the current
# generator no longer produces are orphaned with their original mtime
# and would cause an oldest-output rule to register perpetual staleness.
# The canonical drift case the hook exists to catch is "fresh upstream
# checkpoint, stale downstream checkpoint", and newest-vs-newest catches
# that correctly: if any file in the input tree is newer than the
# newest file in the output tree, the output is definitely stale.
