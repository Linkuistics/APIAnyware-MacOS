# APIAnyware-MacOS

Idiomatic macOS API bindings for every language.

Extracts, analyzes, and generates native bindings for the full macOS platform API surface (ObjC, C, Swift) -- targeting a broad set of languages: Racket, Chez Scheme, Gerbil Scheme, Common Lisp (SBCL, CCL), Haskell, Idris2, OCaml, Prolog, Mercury, Rhombus, Pharo Smalltalk, Zig, and others.

Part of the [APIAnyware](https://linkuistics.com) family by [Linkuistics](https://linkuistics.com) ("The Language of the Web" -- linking languages to platforms). See also `APIAnyware-Windows` and `APIAnyware-Linux` (planned).

## Current Status

The full three-phase pipeline (Collection, Analysis, Generation) is implemented and working end-to-end. The first language target, **Racket OO**, is substantially complete:

- **Collection** extracts 218 ObjC frameworks and 151 Swift modules from the macOS SDK, merging ObjC and Swift declarations into a unified IR.
- **Analysis** runs Datalog-based inheritance resolution, heuristic + LLM semantic annotation (block lifecycle, ownership, threading, error patterns), API pattern recognition (10 stereotype categories, 36+ pattern instances in Foundation alone), and enrichment with verification.
- **Generation** produces Racket OO bindings for all 283 discovered frameworks (312 files for Foundation alone, ~7,500 total), with a 7-file Racket runtime library and a Swift helper dylib providing C-callable ObjC runtime access.
- **4 of 7 sample apps** are implemented for Racket OO: hello-window, counter, ui-controls-gallery, and file-lister. Sample apps can be packaged as proper macOS `.app` bundles (with correct `CFBundleName` and per-app TCC identity) via `apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo`.
- **Racket Functional** emitter crate exists as a registered stub; not yet implemented.
- **Snapshot tests** use a synthetic TestKit framework plus a curated Foundation subset for regression testing.
- **249 Rust tests** and **64 Swift tests** cover the pipeline.

All other language targets (Chez Scheme, Gerbil, Common Lisp, Haskell, Idris2, OCaml, Prolog/Mercury, Rhombus, Pharo Smalltalk, Zig) are planned but not yet started.

## Goals

- **Idiomatic, not mechanical.** Each target language gets bindings that feel native -- not a lowest-common-denominator C wrapper. A Haskell user gets monadic error handling; a Smalltalk user gets message-passing objects; an OCaml user gets modules and variants.
- **Multiple binding styles per language.** Languages with both OO and functional idioms (e.g., Common Lisp, OCaml, Racket) can produce both an object-oriented API and a functional/procedural API from the same enriched IR.
- **Full API coverage.** Every framework in the macOS SDK, not just Foundation and AppKit. Both ObjC and Swift-only APIs.
- **API pattern recognition.** Many APIs implement stereotypical patterns -- builder sequences, open/use/close lifecycles, observer registration/removal pairs, begin/commit transactions. The analysis phase recognizes these cross-method behavioral contracts and encodes them in the IR, enabling emitters to produce idiomatic wrappers like `with-path` (Lisp/Scheme), `withCGContext` (Haskell), or RAII guards (Zig) automatically.
- **Auto-generated with human-quality results.** The enriched IR carries enough semantic information (ownership, threading, block lifecycle, error patterns, API usage patterns) for emitters to make intelligent wrapping decisions without per-method human intervention.

## Architecture

Three-phase pipeline, each communicating via JSON checkpoint files:

```
Collection ──► Analysis ──► Generation
```

**Collection** parses macOS SDK headers (libclang) and Swift modules (swift-api-digester) to produce raw API metadata with full provenance and documentation references. Discovers 218 ObjC frameworks and 151 Swift modules automatically.

**Analysis** resolves inheritance via Datalog (ascent crate), adds semantic annotations (block invocation style, parameter ownership, threading constraints, error patterns, API usage patterns) via heuristics and LLM analysis, then enriches with Datalog-derived relations for generation. API pattern recognition identifies stereotypical multi-method contracts (builder sequences, resource lifecycles, observer pairs) by analyzing Apple's guides and tutorials in addition to API reference documentation. Includes verification rules that flag annotation inconsistencies.

**Generation** emits per-language bindings with runtime support libraries and Swift helper dylibs. Each emitter reads the same enriched IR but produces output shaped to the target language's idioms and conventions. Currently produces Racket OO bindings for all 283 frameworks.

## Pipeline & Checkpoints

Each phase reads the previous checkpoint and writes the next. Intermediate checkpoints allow re-running expensive steps (especially LLM annotation) independently.

| Checkpoint | Location | Produced by | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| Collected | `collection/ir/collected/` | `apianyware-macos-collect` | Raw declarations, provenance, doc refs |
| Resolved | `analysis/ir/resolved/` | `apianyware-macos-analyze resolve` | + inheritance, effective methods, ownership |
| Annotated | `analysis/ir/annotated/` | `apianyware-macos-analyze annotate` + LLM | + block/threading/ownership/pattern annotations |
| Enriched | `analysis/ir/enriched/` | `apianyware-macos-analyze enrich` | + derived relations, pattern instances, verification |
| Generated | `generation/targets/{lang}/generated/` | `apianyware-macos-generate` | Per-language, per-style bindings |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (see `.tool-versions`)
- Xcode (provides libclang and swift-api-digester)

### Collect API metadata from the SDK

```sh
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-collect
```

Discovers all frameworks in the macOS SDK and writes `collection/ir/collected/{Framework}.json`.

### Run the analysis pipeline

```sh
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-analyze
```

Runs resolve -> annotate -> enrich on all collected frameworks. Individual steps:

```sh
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-analyze -- resolve     # Datalog pass 1
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-analyze -- annotate    # heuristics + LLM merge
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-analyze -- enrich      # Datalog pass 2 + verification
```

### Generate language bindings

```sh
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-generate
```

Generates bindings for all registered languages and all binding styles from the enriched IR. To generate for a specific language:

```sh
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-generate -- --lang racket-oo
cargo run -p apianyware-macos-generate -- --list-languages    # show available emitters
```

Output goes to `generation/targets/{lang}/generated/{style}/`.

### LLM annotation (Claude Code)

Open this project in Claude Code and run:

```
/analyze
```

This reads resolved IR, fetches Apple documentation, and produces semantic annotations. The annotations are checked into `analysis/ir/annotated/` and only need to be re-run when the SDK updates.

Alternatively, use any OpenAI-compatible API:

```sh
./analysis/scripts/llm-annotate.sh
```

## Development

### Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Rust workspace
cargo build                                    # Build all crates
cargo test --workspace                         # Run all tests (~248 tests)
cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo  # Single crate
cargo +nightly fmt                             # Format (requires nightly)
cargo clippy --workspace                       # Lint

# Swift dylibs (from repo root)
cd swift && swift build                        # Build all dylibs
cd swift && swift test                         # Run Swift tests (~64 tests)

# Snapshot tests: update golden files after emitter changes
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test --workspace
```

### Coding Conventions

- **TDD** -- write tests first
- **Descriptive names** -- long is fine; consistency matters (don't mix
  `get_thing`/`fetch_thing`)
- **Small files** -- each file handles one concern
- **`thiserror`** for library errors, **`anyhow`** for CLI/application errors
- **`tracing`** macros only (not `log` crate)
- **Bounded channels only** -- `unbounded_channel` is banned
- **No `unwrap`/`expect`** in production code
- **Import grouping**: stdlib -> external -> local (enforced by rustfmt)
- **`cargo +nightly fmt`** before committing

### Crate Map

**Shared types** -- `collection/crates/types/` (`apianyware-macos-types`):
IR structs (Framework, Class, Method, Property, Protocol, Enum, TypeRef),
annotation schema, checkpoint format. Depended on by everything.

**Collection** -- `collection/crates/extract-objc/` (libclang parsing),
`extract-swift/` (swift-api-digester), `cli/` (orchestration). The ObjC
extractor's `type_mapping.rs` resolves typedefs to canonical types at
extraction time -- this is critical for correct FFI signatures downstream.

**Analysis** -- `analysis/crates/datalog/` (shared Ascent-based relations),
`resolve/` (inheritance flattening, ownership detection), `annotate/`
(heuristic + LLM annotation merge), `enrich/` (derived relations,
verification), `cli/`.

**Generation** -- `generation/crates/emit/` (shared framework: `FfiTypeMapper`
trait, `CodeWriter`, naming utils, snapshot testing, pattern dispatch),
`emit-racket-oo/` (Racket OO emission), `cli/` (emitter registry,
orchestration).

**Tooling** -- `generation/crates/stub-launcher/`
(`apianyware-macos-stub-launcher`): generates per-app Swift stub binaries
for TCC-compatible `.app` bundles. Each stub `execv`s into the language
runtime, giving it a unique CDHash so macOS TCC grants permissions per-app
rather than per-runtime. See [App Bundling](#app-bundling) below.

**Swift dylibs** -- `swift/` contains `APIAnywareCommon` (C-callable ObjC
runtime: message sending, memory management, struct marshaling) and
per-language bridges (`APIAnywareRacket` adds block/delegate bridging with
GC prevention).

### Key Patterns

- **`effective_methods()`/`effective_properties()`** in emitters: choose
  between direct and inherited method lists, with deduplication by
  selector/name.
- **`DispatchStrategy`** in emit-racket-oo: methods dispatch via either
  `tell` (Racket's ObjC FFI macro) or typed `_msg-N` bindings depending on
  parameter/return types.
- **`coerce-arg`** in Racket runtime: auto-converts strings -> NSString,
  objc-object -> _id pointer. All generated property setters use it.
- **Snapshot tests**: golden files at `emit-{lang}/tests/golden/{style}/`.
  `GoldenTest::assert_matches()` does directory comparison with unified
  diffs. `assert_subset_matches()` checks only files present in the golden
  dir.
- **`test_fixtures::build_snapshot_test_framework()`**: deterministic
  synthetic `TestKit` framework exercising all emitter code paths.

### App Bundling

Sample apps need to be packaged as proper macOS `.app` bundles for two
reasons:

1. **Menu bar app name.** Cocoa reads the bold app name in the menu bar
   from `CFBundleName` in `Info.plist`. An unbundled `racket script.rkt`
   process shows up as "racket"; a bundled process shows the real app
   name. `NSProcessInfo setProcessName:` is filtered by modern macOS and
   doesn't help.
2. **Per-app TCC permissions** (Accessibility, Camera, Screen Recording,
   etc.). macOS TCC keys permission grants on the binary's CDHash. Without
   a unique stub binary per app, every Racket app shares one TCC entry
   under `/opt/homebrew/bin/racket`.

The bundling story is layered: a language-agnostic primitive
(`stub-launcher`) plus a per-language convention crate
(`bundle-racket-oo` for Racket OO).

#### Per-language convention: `apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo`

For racket-oo sample apps, use `apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo`. It
walks the entry script's transitive `(require ...)` tree to discover
exactly which runtime modules and generated bindings are needed, and
copies that subset into the bundle's `Resources/` preserving the source
layout so the script's relative `../../runtime` and `../../generated/oo/...`
paths still resolve at runtime.

```sh
cargo run --example bundle_app -p apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo -- file-lister
# → generation/targets/racket-oo/apps/file-lister/build/File Lister.app
```

The `file-lister` argument is the script name (the `apps/<name>/<name>.rkt`
identifier). Display name (`File Lister`) and bundle id
(`com.linkuistics.FileLister`) are derived from the kebab-case form. Full
API:

```rust
use apianyware_macos_bundle_racket_oo::{bundle_app, AppSpec};

let spec = AppSpec::from_script_name("file-lister");
let source_root = Path::new("generation/targets/racket-oo");
let output_dir = Path::new("generation/targets/racket-oo/apps/file-lister/build");
let app_path = bundle_app(&spec, source_root, output_dir)?;
```

Resulting bundle layout (Resources mirrors the source tree so relative
requires keep working):

```
File Lister.app/
  Contents/
    MacOS/File Lister                 <- Swift stub, execvs into racket
    Info.plist                        <- CFBundleName = "File Lister"
    Resources/racket-app/
      apps/file-lister/file-lister.rkt
      runtime/*.rkt                   <- only files the entry transitively requires
      generated/oo/{appkit,foundation}/...
      lib/libAPIAnywareRacket.dylib   <- if present in the source tree
```

The walker only copies what the script actually requires — frameworks
the script doesn't import (CoreText, WebKit, etc.) stay out of the
bundle. Built bundles live under `apps/<name>/build/` and are
gitignored.

#### Language-agnostic primitive: `apianyware-macos-stub-launcher`

The lower-level crate handles the parts that are not Racket-specific:
generating the Swift launcher source, compiling it via `swiftc`,
producing `Info.plist`, and assembling the `.app` skeleton. New language
targets get their own bundle convention crate that wraps it.

```rust
use apianyware_macos_stub_launcher::{StubConfig, create_app_bundle};

let config = StubConfig {
    app_name: "Counter".into(),                     // Bundle and binary name
    runtime_path: "/opt/homebrew/bin/racket".into(), // Baked in at compile time
    runtime_args: vec![],                            // Extra args before script path
    script_resource_name: "main".into(),             // Script filename (no ext)
    script_resource_type: "rkt".into(),              // Script extension
    script_resource_dir: "racket-app".into(),        // Subdir in Resources/
    bundle_identifier: "com.example.Counter".into(), // CFBundleIdentifier
};
let app_path = create_app_bundle(&config, Path::new("output/"))?;
// Caller populates: output/Counter.app/Contents/Resources/racket-app/
// (Use bundle-racket-oo to do this automatically for Racket OO apps.)
```

Lower-level API: `generate_stub_source()` and `compile_stub()` for custom
workflows, `generate_info_plist()` for standalone plist generation.

### GUI Testing with GUIVisionVMDriver

Sample apps are tested in a macOS VM via `{{DEV_ROOT}}/GUIVisionVMDriver/`
(the successor to TestAnyware). Never run GUI apps directly from the CLI
-- always use the VM for visual verification. Two channels per VM:

- **Agent** (HTTP on port 8648): exec, file upload/download, accessibility
  snapshot/inspect, UI actions
- **VNC**: screenshots, OCR via `find-text`, keyboard/mouse input

Key workflow:

```bash
GVD={{DEV_ROOT}}/GUIVisionVMDriver
GV=$GVD/cli/macos/.build/release/guivision

# Boot a fresh VM with a viewer attached
source $GVD/scripts/macos/vm-start.sh --viewer
# After sourcing, $GUIVISION_AGENT and $GUIVISION_VNC are set.
# (They DO NOT survive shell boundaries — re-derive in subsequent calls
# from `tart ip guivision-default`, or save the values to /tmp.)

# Install Racket once per fresh clone (~5 min cold)
$GV exec --agent "$GUIVISION_AGENT" "/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install minimal-racket"

# Build and ship a sample app as a .app bundle
cargo run --example bundle_app -p apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo -- file-lister
APP="generation/targets/racket-oo/apps/file-lister/build/File Lister.app"
tar -C "$(dirname "$APP")" -czf /tmp/app.tgz "$(basename "$APP")"
$GV upload --agent "$GUIVISION_AGENT" /tmp/app.tgz /Users/admin/app.tgz
$GV exec --agent "$GUIVISION_AGENT" "tar -xzf /Users/admin/app.tgz -C /Users/admin/ && open '/Users/admin/File Lister.app'"

# Verify visually
$GV agent snapshot --agent "$GUIVISION_AGENT" --window "File Lister"
$GV screenshot --connect /tmp/gv_connect.json -o /tmp/screen.png
$GV find-text --connect /tmp/gv_connect.json "File Lister"

# Always kill before relaunch
$GV exec --agent "$GUIVISION_AGENT" "pkill -9 -f racket"

# Tear down
source $GVD/scripts/macos/vm-stop.sh
```

App specs at `knowledge/apps/{app}/spec.md`, validation checklists at
`knowledge/apps/{app}/test-strategy.md`. The bundling step is required
for menu-bar app names and per-app TCC permissions — running the script
directly via `racket file-lister.rkt` shows up as "racket" in the menu
bar.

### Target Languages

| Language | Style(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Racket OO | OO (classes) | Emitter complete, 283 frameworks generated, 4/7 sample apps, snapshot tests, app bundling |
| Racket Functional | Functional (procedures) | Crate registered, stub emitter |
| Chez Scheme | Functional | Planned (Swift dylib stub exists) |
| Gerbil Scheme | OO + functional | Planned (Swift dylib stub exists) |
| Common Lisp (SBCL, CCL) | CLOS + functional | Planned |
| Haskell | Monadic + lens-based | Planned |
| Idris2 | Dependently-typed wrappers | Planned |
| OCaml | Modules + OO | Planned |
| Prolog / Mercury | Relational | Planned |
| Rhombus | OO (classes) | Planned |
| Pharo Smalltalk | Message-passing OO | Planned |
| Zig | Low-level procedural | Planned |

Languages with both OO and functional paradigms produce multiple binding styles from the same enriched IR -- for example, Common Lisp gets both CLOS wrappers and a `defun`-based procedural API.
