;; objc-interop.rkt — Curated re-export of ObjC interop primitives.
;;
;; Lets consumer modules (apps, downstream binding consumers like Modaliser)
;; write `(require ".../runtime/objc-interop.rkt")` instead of pulling in
;; `ffi/unsafe` and `ffi/unsafe/objc` directly. A grep for `ffi/unsafe` in
;; consumer code then flags genuine escape-hatch usage rather than benign
;; macro/type imports.
;;
;; Add a name here only when consumer code outside `runtime/` legitimately
;; needs it — this is a curated allowlist, not a wholesale re-export.
