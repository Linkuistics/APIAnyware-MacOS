//! Swift stub launcher generator for TCC-compatible macOS app bundles.
//!
//! Generates and compiles per-app Swift stub binaries that `execv` into a language
//! runtime. Each stub has a unique CDHash, allowing macOS TCC (Transparency, Consent,
//! Control) to grant permissions per-app rather than per-runtime binary.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use apianyware_macos_stub_launcher::{StubConfig, create_app_bundle};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let config = StubConfig {
//!     app_name: "Counter".into(),
//!     runtime_path: "/opt/homebrew/bin/racket".into(),
//!     runtime_args: vec![],
//!     script_resource_name: "main".into(),
//!     script_resource_type: "rkt".into(),
//!     script_resource_dir: "racket-app".into(),
//!     bundle_identifier: "com.example.Counter".into(),
//!     signing_identity: None,
//! };
//!
//! let app_path = create_app_bundle(&config, Path::new("/tmp/output")).unwrap();
//! ```
