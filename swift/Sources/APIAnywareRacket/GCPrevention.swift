// GCPrevention.swift — Reference registry preventing GC collection of live callbacks.
//
// When Racket (or Chez/Gerbil) creates a C function pointer via its FFI,
// the underlying closure can be garbage-collected if the language runtime
// doesn't see any references to it. If ObjC holds that pointer (e.g., as
// a block invoke or delegate IMP), the GC'd pointer becomes a dangling
// reference -> crash.
//
// This module provides a simple registry: store a raw pointer with a handle,
// retrieve it later, and release when no longer needed.
//
// Note: this registry does NOT retain ObjC objects (no Unmanaged.retain).
// It stores raw pointer values to prevent the *language runtime's GC* from
// collecting the backing allocation. The caller manages ObjC refcounting
// separately via aw_common_retain/aw_common_release.
//
// Exports: aw_racket_prevent_gc, aw_racket_allow_gc, aw_racket_gc_count
