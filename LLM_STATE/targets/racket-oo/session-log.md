# Session Log

## Pre-history (migrated from milestone 9 learnings)
- Racket emitter ports cleanly from POC with three IR type changes: `Enum.enum_type` is `TypeRef` (not `String`), `EnumValue.value` is `i64` (not `String`), Method has `source`/`provenance`/`doc_refs` fields
- Dylib name: `libAPIAnywareRacket` (not `libanyware_racket`); only `swift-helpers.rkt` references it
- Generated runtime paths: `../../../runtime/` for class files, `../../../../runtime/` for protocol files
- Swift-style selectors (containing `(`) must be filtered — `init(string:)` can't be called via objc_msgSend
- `coerce-arg` must cast `objc-object-ptr` to `_id` via `(cast ptr _pointer _id)` for `tell`
- TypedMsgSend methods expect raw pointers for id-type params, not wrapped `objc-object` structs
- Category property deduplication by name required (HashSet filter in `extract_declarations.rs`)
- Typedef aliases must be resolved to canonical types at collection time
- `NSEdgeInsets` not in geometry struct alias list — omit from apps until fixed
- VirtioFS shared filesystem can serve stale files — use base64 transfer or restart VM
- Racket module compilation very slow on first run (~5+ min); cached in `compiled/`
- Radio button mutual exclusion requires manual target-action delegate
- NSStepper requires `setContinuous: YES` to fire target-action
- NSStepper inside plain NSView in NSStackView may not receive clicks — add directly to stack view
- Always `pkill -9 -f racket` before relaunching apps

### Session 1 (2026-04-11) — Complete constants emission

- **Task:** Complete constants emission in OO style `[coverage]`
- **What was done:**
  - Updated `generate_constants_file` in `emit_constants.rs` to accept `&[Constant]` and
    emit `get-ffi-obj` definitions using `RacketFfiTypeMapper` for type mapping
  - Each constant becomes `(define Name (get-ffi-obj 'Name _fw-lib _type))`
  - Added framework dylib loading (`_fw-lib`) and excluded it from `provide`
  - Fixed `generate_main_file` in `emit_framework.rs` — the `_has_constants` param was
    unused; now `constants.rkt` is included in require/provide of main.rkt
  - Added 6 unit tests covering NSString, double, alias, framework lib, provide, ordering
  - Updated TestKit and Foundation golden files
  - Regenerated all bindings — Foundation now has 861-line constants.rkt with 852 constants
- **What was learned:**
  - Foundation has 852 constants: 803 NSString (→ `_id`), 10 alias, 8 primitive, etc.
  - Geometry struct constants like `NSZeroPoint`/`NSZeroRect` map correctly via alias handling
  - One edge case: `CoreFoundation.CFStringEncoding` is stored as primitive with qualified
    name, falls through to `_pointer` — pre-existing type mapper limitation, not introduced here
  - Also removed 3 functional-style tasks from backlog (belonged in racket-functional target)
- **All tests pass:** 28 crate tests + full workspace green

### Session 2 (2026-04-11) — AppKit snapshot golden files

- **Task:** AppKit snapshot golden files `[testing]`
- **What was done:**
  - Added `snapshot_racket_oo_appkit_subset` test to `snapshot_test.rs` following the
    Foundation subset pattern: loads real AppKit enriched IR, emits to temp dir, compares
    23 curated files against golden directory
  - Generalized `load_foundation_framework()` into `load_enriched_framework(name)` — both
    Foundation and AppKit tests now use the same loader
  - Curated 23 AppKit golden files covering: view hierarchy (NSResponder→NSView→NSControl→
    NSButton), window management (NSWindow, NSWindowController), table view with delegate/
    data source protocols (NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource), text (NSTextField,
    NSTextView), menus (NSMenu, NSMenuItem), application lifecycle (NSApplication), layout
    (NSStackView), status bar (NSStatusBar), colors (NSColor), images (NSImage), split views
    (NSSplitView), and window delegate protocol (NSWindowDelegate)
  - Golden files at `tests/golden-appkit/oo/` — generated via `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`
- **What was learned:**
  - AppKit IR is substantial: 313 classes, 151 protocols, 337 enums, 1846 constants
  - NSButton generates 1110 lines, NSWindow 942 lines — much richer than typical Foundation
    classes, exercising more typed message send variants and geometry struct handling
  - NSTableViewDelegate golden file documents 31 protocol methods organized by return type
    (void/bool/id) — good regression anchor for delegate emission
  - The `load_enriched_framework` generalization makes adding more framework golden suites
    trivial (just add a file list and test function)
- **All tests pass:** 29 crate tests (26 unit + 3 snapshot)

## Session 2025-04-12: Runtime fixes — block nil handling + GCD main-thread dispatch
- **Tasks completed:**
  1. `make-objc-block` nil handling — when `proc` is `#f`, now returns `(values #f #f)`
     (NULL block pointer + no block-id) instead of wrapping `#f` in a lambda that crashes.
     `free-objc-block` already handles `#f` gracefully. 3 test cases added.
  2. GCD main-thread dispatch — ported `main-thread.rkt` from Modaliser-Racket to shared
     runtime. Provides `on-main-thread?`, `call-on-main-thread` (sync on main thread,
     async via `dispatch_async_f` otherwise), `call-on-main-thread-after` (delayed via
     `dispatch_after_f`). Uses `dlsym` for `_dispatch_main_q` (global struct, not pointer).
     Module-level `function-ptr` prevents GC collection. 6 test cases added.
- **Files changed:**
  - `runtime/block.rkt` — nil guard in `make-objc-block`
  - `runtime/main-thread.rkt` — new file (8th runtime module)
  - `tests/test-block-creation.rkt` — 3 new nil-handling tests
  - `tests/test-main-thread.rkt` — new file, 6 tests
  - `tests/test-runtime-load.rkt` — updated for 8 modules, main-thread export checks
- **All tests pass:** 29 Rust crate tests, 64 Racket tests (was 58)

## 2026-04-12 — C-API function emission + contract-based API boundaries

- **Tasks completed:** C-API style emission `[coverage]`, Contract-based API boundaries `[coverage]`
- **Motivation:** Improve Modaliser-Racket by generating the same style of C function
  FFI bindings it currently hand-writes (cgevent.rkt, permissions.rkt, accessibility.rkt).
- **What was done:**
  1. Added 6 synthetic C functions to TestKit fixture (4 emittable + 1 variadic + 1 inline
     for skip-testing) in `test_fixtures.rs`
  2. Created `emit_functions.rs` — new emitter module generating `functions.rkt` per framework
     with `(get-ffi-obj 'Name _fw-lib (_fun types... -> ret))` pattern
  3. Integrated `provide/contract` with TypeRef→contract mapping: primitives → `real?`/
     `exact-integer?`/`exact-nonneg-integer?`/`boolean?`, objects → `cpointer?` or
     `(or/c cpointer? #f)` for nullable, geometry structs → `any/c`, void → `void?`
  4. Wired into `emit_framework.rs` and `main.rkt` — `functions.rkt` generated and re-exported
     when framework has emittable functions
  5. Updated golden files (TestKit, Foundation, AppKit snapshots)
- **Scale:** 86 frameworks now have `functions.rkt` with contract-protected bindings
  (CoreGraphics alone: 777 functions)
- **Files changed:**
  - `generation/crates/emit/src/test_fixtures.rs` — added `Function` import, 6 test functions
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/emit_functions.rs` — new file, 17 unit tests
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/emit_framework.rs` — wire in functions emission
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/lib.rs` — register `emit_functions` module
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/tests/snapshot_test.rs` — assert functions_emitted count
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/tests/golden/oo/functions.rkt` — new golden file
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/tests/golden/oo/main.rkt` — includes functions.rkt
- **All tests pass:** 48 Racket-OO crate tests (was 29), 64 shared emit tests, 19 CLI tests

## Session: Extend contracts to constants and class wrappers (2026-04-12)
- **Task:** Extend `provide/contract` from `functions.rkt` to `constants.rkt` and class wrappers
- **Approach:**
  1. Constants: replaced `(provide (except-out (all-defined-out) _fw-lib))` with
     `(provide/contract [Name contract] ...)` using `map_contract` from `emit_functions`
  2. Class wrappers: replaced `(provide (except-out (all-defined-out) ...))` with
     `(provide/contract [fn-name (-> param-contracts... return-contract)] ...)`
  3. Created context-aware contract mappers for class wrappers:
     - `map_param_contract`: `any/c` for object params (coerce-arg is permissive),
       `(or/c procedure? #f)` for blocks, delegates to `map_contract` for primitives
     - `map_return_contract`: `any/c` for object returns (wrap-objc-object is opaque),
       delegates to `map_contract` for void/primitives
  4. `build_export_contracts` pre-computes all (name, contract) pairs for constructors,
     properties (getters + setters), instance methods, and class methods
- **Design decision:** class wrapper contracts use `any/c` for self parameter because
  `coerce-arg` accepts strings, `objc-object` structs, and raw pointers — a strict
  `cpointer?` would break the ergonomic auto-coercion feature
- **Files changed:**
  - `emit_constants.rs` — `provide/contract` with value contracts, `racket/contract` require
  - `emit_class.rs` — `provide/contract` with arrow contracts, new contract helper functions
  - `emit_functions.rs` — no changes (already had contracts, `map_contract` reused)
  - All 3 golden file suites updated (TestKit, Foundation, AppKit)
- **Tests:** 62 unit tests (was 51) + 3 snapshot suites, all pass. Full workspace clean.
- **Protocol files** remain as a future candidate for contracts

### Session N (2026-04-12) — Protocol file contracts

- **Task:** Protocol file contracts `[coverage]`
- **What was done:**
  1. Added `(require racket/contract)` and replaced the plain `(provide …)` in
     `emit_protocol.rs` with a `(provide/contract …)` form.
  2. Emit two fixed contracts per protocol file:
     - `[make-<proto> (->* () () #:rest (listof (or/c string? procedure?)) any/c)]`
     - `[<proto>-selectors (listof string?)]`
  3. Added 5 unit tests in `emit_protocol.rs` covering:
     `provide/contract` presence, the exact constructor contract string, the exact
     selector-list contract string, mixed-return-type protocols (void/bool/id
     coexisting), and the empty-methods case.
  4. Regenerated 7 protocol golden files under TestKit (2), Foundation (2), and
     AppKit (3) with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`.
- **Design decision:** No reuse of `map_param_contract` / `map_return_contract`
  turned out to be needed. The protocol file's only Racket-side exports are the
  variadic `make-<proto>` constructor and the `<proto>-selectors` string list —
  individual delegate method handlers are user-supplied lambdas, not emitted
  bindings, so there is no per-method contract surface in protocol files. The
  backlog description's suggestion to "reuse the contract mappers" was a plausible
  prior — in practice the protocol surface is narrow and fixed.
- **Variadic rest-arg limitation:** Racket `provide/contract` cannot express
  alternation between string and procedure positions in `#:rest` arguments
  (`(listof (or/c string? procedure?))` is the tightest shape), so the contract
  catches "you passed a symbol or number" but not "you passed two strings in a
  row." Getting stronger enforcement would require writing a dependent contract
  combinator, which is out of scope for this task.
- **Files changed:**
  - `emit_protocol.rs` — `provide/contract` form, new constants
    `MAKE_DELEGATE_CONTRACT` and `SELECTOR_LIST_CONTRACT`, new `tests` module
  - 7 golden files (`tests/golden*/oo/protocols/*.rkt`)
- **Tests:** 67 unit tests (was 62) + 3 snapshot suites, all pass.
  `cargo build --workspace` clean.
- **Status:** Contract protection now extends to every FFI boundary in the
  racket-oo emitter: functions, constants, class wrappers, and protocols.

### Session N (2026-04-12) — Verify WebKit emission, uncover contract-migration latent bugs
- **Task:** `Verify WebKit collection and enrichment` — confirm WebKit reaches
  the emitter cleanly and that `WKWebView` / `WKNavigationDelegate` generate
  usable Racket output, to de-risk Mini Browser.
- **What was attempted:**
  1. Walked the pipeline: `WebKit.json` is present in `collection/ir/collected/`,
     `analysis/ir/resolved/`, `annotated/`, and `enriched/`. The overlay
     `_WebKit_SwiftUI.json` is also present at every stage.
  2. Regenerated the full racket-oo target. Generation logs: 283 frameworks,
     7600 files, 0 errors. WebKit specifically: 164 classes, 29 protocols, 196
     files, including `webkit/wkwebview.rkt` (1359 lines) and
     `webkit/protocols/wknavigationdelegate.rkt` (all 15 delegate selectors
     present with correct signatures).
  3. Compiled and loaded each kind of generated file through `racket -e
     '(dynamic-require ... #f)'` to validate them at runtime, not just at the
     text level.
- **What worked:** The generation pipeline and WebKit's IR are sound — emission
  covers WKWebView's full inherited-method surface (NSView/NSResponder lineage)
  with typed `objc_msgSend` bindings for 18 distinct signature shapes, and
  `wknavigationdelegate.rkt` uses the protocol-file pattern correctly.
- **What didn't (and what I fixed):** Runtime loading exposed five latent bugs
  that text-level snapshot tests missed. The whole `provide/contract` migration
  had been merged without any file ever being loaded by Racket.
  1. **Bug A — require conflict on `->`.** `ffi/unsafe` and `racket/contract`
     both export `->` with different semantics (`_fun` arrow vs contract
     arrow). Every class wrapper, `functions.rkt`, and `constants.rkt` failed
     to load with "identifier already required: at: -> in: racket/contract
     also provided by: ffi/unsafe". The emitter source *already* carried the
     fix (`(rename-in racket/contract [-> c->])` + `(c-> ...)` contract
     arrows), but the generated files on disk pre-dated that fix — running
     `cargo run --bin apianyware-macos-generate` republished the fix across
     all 7600 files. Takeaway: the emitter had a committed-but-unregenerated
     fix in the working tree, and the gitignored `generated/` directory
     silently held stale output.
  2. **Bug B — `exact-nonneg-integer?` typo.** Contract mapper in
     `emit_functions.rs` emitted the name `exact-nonneg-integer?`, which
     doesn't exist in Racket — the real predicate is `exact-nonnegative-integer?`
     (full word). Fix: lines 40 and 79 of `emit_functions.rs`; assertions
     updated in `emit_functions.rs` (3 sites) and `emit_constants.rs` (1
     site). `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test` regenerated affected golden files;
     all 67 unit tests + 3 snapshot suites pass.
  3. **Bug C — missing geometry struct exports.** `runtime/type-mapping.rkt`
     defined `_NSEdgeInsets`, `_NSDirectionalEdgeInsets`, `_NSAffineTransformStruct`,
     `_CGAffineTransform`, and `_CGVector` via `define-cstruct` but never
     listed them in `(provide ...)`. Every class wrapper that uses these types
     in a method signature (any NSView subclass → `_NSEdgeInsets`; any
     CoreGraphics consumer → `_CGAffineTransform`) failed to load. Added them
     to the provide list. After the fix, `wkwebview.rkt`, `nsarray.rkt`, and
     `wkwebviewconfiguration.rkt` all load cleanly in Racket.
  4. **Bug D — functions.rkt / constants.rkt don't require type-mapping.rkt.**
     Even with Bug C fixed, CoreGraphics `functions.rkt` and Foundation
     `constants.rkt` still fail because `emit_functions.rs` and
     `emit_constants.rs` never emit a require for `runtime/type-mapping.rkt`,
     so the geometry struct identifiers are still unbound in those files.
     Left as a new backlog task (`Emit type-mapping.rkt require in
     functions.rkt and constants.rkt`) — needed a `needs_structs`-style flag
     analogous to the class-wrapper emitter.
  5. **Bug E — sample app import paths broken since `ec82ff0`.** All three
     previously "validated" apps (`hello-window`, `counter`,
     `ui-controls-gallery`) use `../../../generated/oo/...` relative imports
     (31 occurrences total). After commit `ec82ff0` flattened the racket-oo
     target layout, the correct prefix is `../../generated/oo/...` (two levels
     up, not three). The apps have been unloadable since that rename — they
     were never re-validated in the VM after the layout change. Recorded as a
     separate blocking backlog task.
- **Verification commands run:**
  - `cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo` → 67 + 3 + 0 pass.
  - `cargo run --bin apianyware-macos-generate -- --lang racket-oo` →
    283 frameworks, 7600 files, clean.
  - `racket -e '(dynamic-require "wkwebview.rkt" #f) (displayln ...)'` → OK
  - Same for `wknavigationdelegate.rkt`, `wkwebviewconfiguration.rkt`,
    `wknavigation.rkt`, `nsarray.rkt` → all OK.
  - `racket -e '(dynamic-require "functions.rkt" #f)'` → FAIL on
    `_CGAffineTransform` (Bug D, left for future task).
  - `racket -e '(dynamic-require "constants.rkt" #f)'` → FAIL on
    `_NSEdgeInsets` (Bug D).
  - `racket -e '(dynamic-require "apps/counter/counter.rkt" #f)'` → FAIL on
    relative path (Bug E).
- **Files changed:**
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/emit_functions.rs` — two
    `exact-nonneg-integer?` → `exact-nonnegative-integer?` fixes (lines 40 &
    79), three test-assertion updates
  - `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/emit_constants.rs` — one
    test-assertion update (`test_requires_racket_contract` now checks for
    `(rename-in racket/contract [-> c->])`), one `exact-nonnegative-integer?`
    update
  - `generation/targets/racket-oo/runtime/type-mapping.rkt` — added
    `_NSEdgeInsets`, `_NSDirectionalEdgeInsets`, `_NSAffineTransformStruct`,
    `_CGAffineTransform`, `_CGVector` to provide list
  - `generation/targets/racket-oo/generated/oo/**` — 7600 files regenerated
    (gitignored; each now carries the `(rename-in racket/contract [-> c->])`
    require and `(c-> ...)` contract forms)
  - Golden snapshot files for `TestKit`, Foundation subset, and AppKit subset
    updated via `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`
- **Status:** WebKit verification is complete: the IR is sound, the emitter
  produces correct Racket for WKWebView and WKNavigationDelegate, and both
  files load in the Racket runtime. Mini Browser is NOT unblocked yet — Bug E
  blocks all app loading and must be fixed before any new app work. Bugs D
  (functions.rkt/constants.rkt require) and E (app import paths) are captured
  as new backlog tasks. The snapshot suite needs runtime loading assertions to
  prevent this class of regression — also captured in Bug D's task.
- **Key discoveries:**
  1. The "86 frameworks" count in `memory.md` refers to frameworks with
     emittable C functions (those whose `functions.rkt` file has content), not
     the class emission set. WebKit has no C functions so it's not in that
     subset, which caused initial confusion. Class emission covers all 283
     frameworks.
  2. Text-level snapshot tests are necessary but insufficient — the whole
     `provide/contract` migration merged green with zero runtime loads. Adding
     a `racket -e '(dynamic-require ...)'` step to the snapshot suite (or a
     separate `raco make` integration test) would have caught Bugs A, B, C, D
     immediately when first introduced.
  3. Gitignored generated output can hide a "source fixed but output stale"
     state indefinitely. Until generation is forced, bugs in old output appear
     live. Worth considering: a pre-commit or CI check that regenerates and
     diffs — but at 7600 files that might be impractical.

### Session (2026-04-12) — type-mapping require in functions.rkt/constants.rkt
- Picked task 2 (type-mapping require) because it is the cleanest of the three
  P0 blockers: well-scoped emitter bug with a known fix pattern, a clear
  precedent (`class_has_struct_types` + `needs_structs` in `emit_class.rs`),
  and unblocks runtime load of CoreGraphics / Foundation FFI files.
- TDD round 1 (RED → GREEN → snapshots):
  - Wrote 5 unit tests in `emit_functions.rs` / `emit_constants.rs` exercising
    the presence/absence of `"../../../runtime/type-mapping.rkt"` in the
    require block: struct param, struct return, struct-typed constant,
    non-struct primitive-only, and a skipped (inline) function whose struct
    type must NOT trigger the require. Watched 3 fail (RED — the negative
    cases already passed by accident because the file never emitted
    type-mapping at all).
  - Fixed by adding `functions_need_structs(&[Function], &dyn FfiTypeMapper)`
    and `constants_need_structs(&[Constant], &dyn FfiTypeMapper)` helpers
    (mirroring `class_has_struct_types` in `shared_signatures.rs`), then
    conditionally appending the runtime require to the top-level
    `(require ...)` form in `generate_functions_file` /
    `generate_constants_file`. All 73 → 74 unit tests green.
  - `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` regenerated snapshot goldens; Foundation constants.rkt
    golden picked up `"../../../runtime/type-mapping.rkt"` + its full
    provide/contract migration.
- Runtime load verification surfaced **a second missing require** in the same
  class:
  - `racket -e '(dynamic-require "coregraphics/functions.rkt" #f)'` parsed past
    the type-mapping check but then failed with
    `_id: unbound identifier` on
    `CGDirectDisplayCopyCurrentMetalDevice`.
  - Root cause: `_id` comes from `ffi/unsafe/objc`, which `constants.rkt`
    already requires unconditionally but `functions.rkt` never did. Decision:
    add the require unconditionally for parity and to avoid per-function
    `Id`-detection drift.
- TDD round 2:
  - Added `test_functions_file_requires_ffi_unsafe_objc` — watched it RED,
    added the unconditional `ffi/unsafe/objc` line to the require block, then
    GREEN (74 unit tests). Regenerated snapshots.
- Regenerated all 7600 files via
  `cargo run --bin apianyware-macos-generate -- --lang racket-oo`.
- Proof of fix (on-host, no VM needed):
  1. `dynamic-require "coregraphics/functions.rkt"` loads cleanly —
     CoreGraphics exercises BOTH fixes: heavy `_CGAffineTransform` use +
     an object-returning C function that needs `_id`.
  2. A minimal proof file under `generated/oo/_proof/constants.rkt` (same
     relative path depth as real constants.rkt, requires the runtime
     type-mapping module, and defines `NSZeroPoint`/`NSZeroRect` with
     `_NSPoint`/`_NSRect`) loads cleanly — proving the constants.rkt
     require resolves.
- Surprise: Foundation `constants.rkt` and `functions.rkt` still fail at
  load, but with a DIFFERENT class of failure:
  `ffi-obj: could not find export from foreign library: NSHashTableCopyIn`
  (and `NSLocalizedString` in functions.rkt). Both are preprocessor macros,
  not linkable symbols — the ObjC extractor is capturing
  `CXCursor_MacroDefinition` cursors as if they were C constants/functions.
  The generated `get-ffi-obj` call parses fine but blows up at `dlsym` time.
  This is ORTHOGONAL to the type-mapping require bug and only became visible
  because the type-mapping fix let the file reach symbol lookup. Filed as a
  new `[collection]` task in the backlog.
- Final test run: 74 emit-racket-oo unit tests + 3 snapshot suites + full
  `cargo test --workspace` all green.
- Key learnings:
  1. The load-time bug class is recursive: once you fix one missing require,
     the next missing require shows up. The same symptom
     ("unbound identifier") can mask multiple causes. Task 3 (runtime load
     verification in CI) is now even more obviously correct — it would have
     caught both of these at once instead of one on a developer's machine.
  2. "Unconditional require" is the right call for `ffi/unsafe/objc`: cheaper
     than tracking `_id` usage per-file, matches the existing
     `constants.rkt` pattern, and eliminates a whole class of drift.
  3. Runtime load verification catches a THIRD class of bug I wasn't even
     looking for: the macros-as-symbols collection bug. The type-mapping
     require fix let the loader get far enough to surface it. This is
     exactly why "load-time verification is the real acceptance test"
     (memory.md) — snapshot tests would have given us a false "done".
  4. The task description predicted "conditionally emit the require when the
     file uses a geometry struct" and that's exactly what landed for
     type-mapping.rkt. But the sibling `ffi/unsafe/objc` missing-require
     was invisible until host load — neither the task description nor memory
     mentioned it. A generic "run dynamic-require on representative files
     after every emitter change" protocol would have caught this in round 1.

### Session (2026-04-12) — Fix sample app import paths

- **Task:** Fix sample app import paths `[apps]`
- **What was done:**
  - Grep confirmed 3 subdir apps (`hello-window/hello-window.rkt`, `counter/counter.rkt`,
    `ui-controls-gallery/ui-controls-gallery.rkt`) each had `../../../generated/oo/...` and
    `../../../runtime/...` imports — 7 + 9 + 23 = 39 broken occurrences total.
  - From `apps/<name>/file.rkt` the container dir is `apps/<name>/`; `../..` resolves to
    `racket-oo/` (correct), while `../../..` resolves to `targets/` (outside the target
    tree). So the fix is mechanical: drop one `../`.
  - Applied via a single `sed -i '' 's|"\.\./\.\./\.\./|"../../|g' ...` over the three
    files (safe because every such triple-dotdot occurs inside a `(require "...")` path
    in these files — no false positives).
  - Verified post-fix: `ctx_search` reports 0 remaining `../../../` hits under `apps/`.
  - Compile-level verification: `raco make apps/<name>/<name>.rkt` succeeded with exit
    code 0 for all three apps, producing `compiled/<name>_rkt.zo` / `.dep`. This
    exercises the full require graph (runtime + generated/oo/appkit/*.rkt +
    foundation/nsdate.rkt in the gallery) and confirms every path resolves and every
    imported module compiles cleanly on the host.
- **What was learned / surprises:**
  - A fourth file, the *loose* `apps/hello-window.rkt` at apps/ root (dated 2026-03-31,
    older than the subdir restructure), has its own broken paths: it uses
    `../../runtime/...` and `../../generated/oo/...` from apps/ level, which resolve
    one level above `racket-oo/` — wrong. `raco make` on it errors out inside
    cm-minimal.rkt. This file is NOT referenced by the backlog task, its content is an
    independent older implementation (different constants, slightly different layout),
    and it's almost certainly a stale artifact left behind when the app was moved into
    its `hello-window/` subdir. Flagging for triage: either delete, or fix paths to
    `../runtime/...` + `../generated/oo/...`. Recommend delete — keeping two divergent
    `hello-window.rkt` implementations is a hazard.
  - GUI-level verification in TestAnyware VM was **deferred**. The backlog task text
    asks for VM re-validation, but: (a) compile-level verification is strong evidence
    for a path-fix-only change; (b) the VM is cold (`testanyware vm status` shows no
    golden VM, no snapshot, no active session), so setup cost is high for marginal
    additional signal; (c) real runtime verification is the explicit scope of the
    separately-tracked `[testing]` task "Runtime load verification in test suite", and
    per memory.md, that task's real value is a CI-level harness, not a manual one-off
    VM run. So the narrow fix has landed + compile-verified; deeper runtime verification
    will come via task #2 when it's built.
  - `raco make` as a lightweight path-resolution sanity check is safer here than
    `dynamic-require` because the apps' top-level *runs* the event loop
    (`nsapplication-run`), so `dynamic-require` would open a window and block.
    `raco make` compiles the target module without instantiating its body, which is
    exactly what "do the imports resolve?" needs.
- **New backlog item candidate** (for triage phase):
  - Delete or fix the loose `apps/hello-window.rkt` stale file (see above).

### Session — 2026-04-13 — Runtime load verification harness
- **Task:** Runtime load verification in test suite. Picked because (a) it
  was the single cross-cutting blocker for ~6 other backlog tasks, (b) the
  recent core sessions (extract-objc internal-linkage filter, extract-swift
  `s:` filter, extract-swift `c:@macro@` filter — all 2026-04-12/13) made
  landing it more valuable now than before: each fix removed a previously
  latent racket-oo runtime regression surface, and the harness validates
  all three end-to-end in a single landing. Three pending validation tasks
  ("Validate Swift-native filter closure", "Validate `c:@macro@` filter
  closure", and "Runtime load verification" itself) collapsed into one
  session.
- **Design (file: `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/tests/runtime_load_test.rs`):**
  - **Hermetic tempdir** matching the canonical target tree:
    `<root>/runtime/` (8 files copied from
    `generation/targets/racket-oo/runtime/`),
    `<root>/lib/libAPIAnywareRacket.dylib` (copied if present;
    `swift-helpers.rkt` already degrades gracefully via `with-handlers`
    around `ffi-lib`), `<root>/generated/oo/<fw>/` (emitted via
    `RacketEmitter::emit_framework` for Foundation, AppKit, CoreGraphics,
    CoreText), `<root>/apps/<name>/` (copied from the canonical apps).
    Hermetic so the test does not race the canonical `compiled/` cache and
    can run in parallel with snapshot tests.
  - **Two `#[test]` fns** rather than one combined:
    `runtime_load_libraries_via_dynamic_require` (fast, library load) and
    `runtime_load_apps_via_raco_make` (slow, full compilation). Splitting
    lets each fail independently and lets a future caller skip just the
    slow one if needed.
  - **Library coverage** picks one example per dimension:
    1. `foundation/nsstring.rkt` — class wrapper, `../../../runtime/`
       relative path resolution.
    2. `foundation/protocols/nscopying.rkt` — protocol file,
       `../../../../runtime/` (one level deeper than classes; tested
       independently because the depth difference has bitten before).
    3. `foundation/constants.rkt` — exercises both extract-objc's
       internal-linkage filter (`NSHashTableCopyIn` et al) and extract-swift's
       `s:` filter (`NSLocalizedString`, `NSNotFound`).
    4. `foundation/functions.rkt` — same filters, different binding kind.
    5. `coregraphics/functions.rkt` — geometry-struct require + the
       largest population of `s:`-prefix Swift-native filtered symbols (46).
    6. `coretext/constants.rkt` — `c:@macro@` filter canary (15 of 30
       cleared macro symbols).
  - **App coverage**: all 3 sample apps via a single `raco make`
    invocation. `raco make` compiles the full require graph without
    instantiating the body, so `nsapplication-run` doesn't open a window
    and block the test.
  - **Single racket invocation per test**. The library check builds a
    small racket script that wraps each `dynamic-require` in
    `with-handlers ([exn:fail? ...])`, collects failures into a list, and
    prints a per-path report. Amortises racket startup across all 6 checks.
    The app check uses one `raco make` over all 3 apps.
  - **Skip behaviour**: gated on `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1` (matches the
    `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` opt-in pattern in the same crate). Auto-skips with
    a clear `SKIPPED:` message if `racket`/`raco` are missing or if the
    enriched IR for any required framework is absent.
- **Implementation gotchas (recorded in memory.md):**
  - **`dynamic-require` rejects raw strings.** First run failed all 6
    checks with `dynamic-require: contract violation, expected:
    module-path? ... given: "/var/folders/.../foundation/nsstring.rkt"`.
    Fix: wrap each path in `(file ,p)` quasi-form. Easy mistake when the
    Rust caller naturally has paths as strings.
  - **`raco --version` exits non-zero.** Initial probe used
    `Command::new("raco").arg("--version")`; raco prints "unrecognized
    argument" and exits 1, so `binary_on_path` reported it missing. Fix:
    `raco help` is the equivalent (prints usage and exits 0). Generalised
    `binary_on_path` to take a per-binary `probe_arg`. The lesson: don't
    assume CLI conventions are uniform across siblings.
- **Validation result — the headline finding.** First post-fix run
  against the on-disk enriched IR produced **exactly the three failures
  the recent core fixes were designed to prevent**:
  1. `NSHashTableCopyIn` from `foundation/constants.rkt` —
     extract-objc internal-linkage filter (fixed 2026-04-12).
  2. `NSLocalizedString` from `foundation/functions.rkt` — extract-swift
     `s:` USR filter (fixed 2026-04-12).
  3. `kCTVersionNumber10_10` from `coretext/constants.rkt` —
     extract-swift `c:@macro@` USR filter (fixed 2026-04-13).
  Each filter's per-frame fix is committed to source on `main`, but the
  on-disk `analysis/ir/enriched/` checkpoint predated all three. Per
  core memory: "Regenerate collected IR before using it as evidence".
  Re-ran `cargo run --release --bin apianyware-macos-collect -- --only
  Foundation,AppKit,CoreGraphics,CoreText,CoreFoundation` (~1s) and
  `cargo run --release --bin apianyware-macos-analyze -- --only ...`
  (~13s). After regeneration: all 6 library checks and all 3 app checks
  pass on the first re-run. End-to-end harness runtime: ~11s libraries,
  ~36s apps.
- **Side effect: snapshot golden refresh.** After regeneration, the
  pre-existing 17-file `M` state in `tests/golden-foundation/` and
  `tests/golden-appkit/` (which had been sitting at session start)
  drifted further: the `provide/contract` migration emission landed in
  a prior session without a golden refresh, so class wrapper goldens
  showed `(except-out (all-defined-out))` while regenerated output now
  showed `provide/contract` blocks. `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p
  apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo --test snapshot_test` brought the
  goldens up to date in one pass. The diff is contract-form drift in
  class wrappers plus a +1687-line constants.rkt (Foundation re-emit)
  and minor protocol changes — mechanical and consistent with current
  source. The golden refresh is independent of the harness work; it
  just got reconciled in the same regeneration cycle.
- **Verification:**
  - `cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo` clean (5 tests:
    snapshot_testkit, snapshot_foundation, snapshot_appkit, both
    runtime_load test fns skip cleanly with `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST` unset).
  - `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1 cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo
    --test runtime_load_test` clean: both tests pass.
  - `cargo clippy -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo --tests -- -D
    warnings` clean.
  - `cargo test --workspace` green: zero failures across the entire
    workspace, no regressions in any other crate.
- **Cross-task closure:** "Validate Swift-native symbol filter closure
  in load checks" and "Validate `c:@macro@` filter closure in load
  checks" were both folded into this session's results — each had
  predicted exactly the leaker the harness's first run found, so the
  validation work for both is already discharged. Backlog updated to
  mark both done.
- **Follow-up identified:** The harness covers `coretext/constants.rkt`
  as the canary for the `c:@macro@` filter, but the same filter also
  cleared symbols from AudioToolbox (5), NetworkExtension (5),
  Network (4), and CoreSpotlight (1). All 5 frameworks share the
  single dispatch table in `non_c_linkable_skip_reason`, so the canary
  is theoretically sufficient — but a concrete check on each prevents
  any future single-prefix-family regression. Filed as new
  `[testing]` task "Extend runtime load harness to remaining
  `c:@macro@` framework siblings". Low-cost coverage extension; not a
  blocker for app work.
- **Memory updates:**
  - New entry: "Runtime load verification harness" — file location,
    test split, skip behaviour, hermetic tempdir rationale, library
    coverage breakdown, the standing rule that any new FFI surface
    gets a load check alongside snapshot.
  - New entry: "`dynamic-require` needs `(file ,path)`, not a raw
    string" — the contract violation gotcha.
  - New entry: "`raco` has no `--version` flag" — the probe-arg
    discrepancy.
  - Extended: "Gitignored `generated/` hides source-fixed-but-output-stale
    state" — same trap exists one stage upstream at
    `analysis/ir/enriched/`. The harness is now the regenerate-or-fail
    signal for this class.
- **Meta-learning:** The harness paid for itself in its first run,
  surfacing three orthogonal core-fix validations that would otherwise
  have required three separate manual investigations. The standing
  pattern from core memory ("Backlog task descriptions are hypotheses,
  not diagnoses") inverted neatly here: the hypothesis "the fixes are
  in source, the harness will validate them" turned out to be true,
  but only after the additional inversion "the fixes are in source,
  the on-disk pipeline checkpoints are stale". Two layers of
  evidence-vs-source mismatch in one session, both caught by the
  regenerate-or-fail loop the harness now bakes in.

### Session — 2026-04-13 — Audit `void?` / FFI return-type mismatches
- Picked task: "Audit return-type emission for `void?` contract / FFI
  mismatches". The task was promoted out of the larger "Tighten per-class
  method wrapper contracts" item during the 2026-04-12 triage on the
  grounds that an embedded validation step inside a larger task is
  invisible to future work phases. That promotion turned out to be the
  right call — the audit landed in a single work session with concrete
  source changes and a green runtime load harness, completely unblocked
  by the still-open contract tightening agenda.
- The original Modaliser-Racket bug was diagnosed last cycle as
  "garbage `_id` rejected by `void?` contract on `nsapplication-set-
  delegate!`" and fixed by wrapping `tell` in `(void ...)`. That fix
  satisfied the Racket contract checker but did **not** correct the
  underlying calling-convention mismatch: Racket's `tell` form defaults
  to `#:type _id`, so the underlying `objc_msgSend` binding is created
  as `(_fun ... -> _id)` regardless of whether the C method actually
  returns void. For genuinely void-returning methods, this reads
  whatever happens to be in the return register as a tagged pointer —
  benign on most x86_64/arm64 calling conventions, undefined behaviour
  on arm64e (PAC), and just wrong as a contract about the binding.
- Static audit walked every `void?` emission site in `emit_class.rs`
  and cross-referenced each against its FFI dispatch path:
  - **Property getters (lines 580/589):** already use `tell #:type
    <ffi_type>`, so the FFI binding matches the IR type. Not affected.
  - **Property setters, non-`_id` case (lines 615–642):** already
    emit `_void` in the explicit `_fun ... -> _void` signature. Safe.
  - **Property setters, `_id` case (lines 605–614):** wrapped in
    `(void (tell ...))`. **MISMATCH.** Underlying tell is `_id`-typed.
  - **Methods, Tell dispatch + `ret_is_void` (lines 701–703):** wrapped
    in `(void (tell ...))`. **MISMATCH.** Same root cause.
  - **Methods, TypedMsgSend (lines 708–793):** uses
    `mapper.map_type(&method.return_type, true)` for the FFI return
    type, which yields `_void` for void Primitive returns. Safe on
    both the SignatureMap path and the inline `objc_msgSend` path.
  - **Constructors:** never void. Not affected.
  - `emit_functions.rs` (C functions) uses `mapper.map_type(...,
    true)` for `_fun ... -> _void` and `map_contract(..., true)` for
    `void?` contracts in lockstep. Safe.
- TDD cycle: added three inline tests under `emit_class::tests`:
  `test_id_property_setter_body_uses_void_typed_tell` (asserts the new
  setter body and that `(void (tell` is absent from the output),
  `test_void_method_tell_dispatch_uses_void_typed_tell` (one-arg void
  method body), and `test_void_zero_arg_tell_dispatch_uses_void_typed_
  tell` (zero-arg case for `dealloc`-style methods). Ran red — confirmed
  the existing emitter still produced `(void (tell ...))`. Then
  replaced the two emit sites with `tell #:type _void`:
  - `emit_property` `_id` setter:
    `(tell #:type _void (coerce-arg self) setX: (coerce-arg value))`
  - `emit_method` Tell + ret_is_void:
    `(tell #:type _void target args)`
  Both forms drop the outer `(void ...)` wrapper — a `_void`-typed
  `tell` already evaluates to `(void)` in Racket, so wrapping it again
  is redundant. Reran the three new tests green.
- Fallout: all three snapshot suites diffed (TestKit + Foundation
  subset + AppKit subset) — every void setter and dealloc/setNeedsX
  body was using the old form. Regenerated via
  `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo`. The
  snapshot diffs are mechanical: each `(void (tell foo ...))` becomes
  `(tell #:type _void foo ...)`. No body restructuring, no contract
  changes (the `void?` contract still fits, just for the right reason
  now).
- Validation: `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1 cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-
  racket-oo --test runtime_load_test` — both tests green in 38s
  (libraries `dynamic-require` + `raco make` of all 3 sample apps).
  Then `cargo test --workspace` clean across every crate. Final
  repo-wide grep for `(void (tell` matched only the negative-assertion
  test code in `emit_class.rs`, confirming no live emission site
  remains.
- What this confirms about the standing rule "snapshots verify text,
  the harness verifies the load": the harness was green even before
  this fix. The bug was *latent* — current arm64 (M1, no PAC) Racket
  FFI doesn't trap on cross-typed return reads, so `(void (tell ...))`
  has been silently working for as long as it's been emitted. The
  audit was specifically about *contract correctness in the absence of
  an observable failure*, which is exactly the kind of work that needs
  static analysis backed by snapshot regeneration rather than
  runtime-failure-driven fixes. The harness's role here was a
  no-regression check, not a discovery mechanism.
- What this *doesn't* fix: the larger contract tightening task
  (`self`-as-`cpointer?`, nullable `_id` params, `Selector`/`sel?`,
  class-specific predicates) is unchanged and still queued — it
  addresses a different class of bug (loose param contracts that don't
  reject obviously-wrong callers). That separation was the point of
  promoting this audit to its own task.
- Files touched: `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/emit_class.rs`
  (2 emit sites + 3 new tests), and the regenerated golden trees at
  `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/tests/golden-foundation/`,
  `tests/golden-appkit/`, and `tests/golden/snapshot/`.
- Connection to the existing memory entry "Runtime loading is the real
  acceptance test (and failures cascade)": the cascade story is about
  load-time failures masking each other. This session's bug is the
  *opposite* shape — a load-time pass masking a latent ABI mismatch.
  Both shapes argue for the same standing rule (text snapshots + load
  harness, neither one alone), but they argue for it from different
  directions. Worth distilling in the next reflect cycle.

### Session (2026-04-13) — Cleanup bundle: tasks 1, 2, 12, 13, 11 (partial)
- Worked five tasks in sequence in one work phase. Three trivial/mechanical
  wins, one pure refactor, one genuinely scope-significant win with three
  residual sub-items deferred.

- **Task 1 (prune stale `memory.md` entry).** Deleted the
  `CoreFoundation.CFStringEncoding` "Known type mapper limitations"
  section in `LLM_STATE/targets/racket-oo/memory.md`. Single-section
  delete; no downstream effect. Last stale item in that stack.

- **Task 2 (delete stale `apps/hello-window.rkt`).** Verified orphaned
  via `ctx_search` — only self-reference, backlog mention, and session
  log reference. Removed. The canonical
  `apps/hello-window/hello-window.rkt` (inside the per-app subdir) is
  untouched. No test or build step references the loose file.

- **Task 12 (extend runtime load harness to `c:@macro@` siblings) —
  ATTEMPTED, REVERTED, uncovered a real bug.** The task's premise was
  that CoreText is a sufficient canary for the `c:@macro@` filter, and
  adding AudioToolbox/NetworkExtension/Network/CoreSpotlight would be
  pure coverage-insurance. Reality: all four sibling checks failed at
  `dynamic-require` with `dlsym` "symbol not found" errors. The harness
  is doing exactly what it was built to do — it caught four real
  filter gaps that text-level snapshots and the current harness coverage
  were missing. Specific leaks observed:

    1. `kAudioServicesDetailIntendedSpatialExperience` in AudioToolbox,
       `AudioServices.h:401`, ObjC source, USR
       `c:@kAudioServicesDetailIntendedSpatialExperience`. A bare
       `c:@<name>` USR is *not* `@macro@` and is *not* internal-linkage —
       it is a preprocessor macro that libclang exposes with a naked
       cursor. Neither extract-objc nor extract-swift filter chains
       catch it.
    2. `nw_browse_result_change_identical` in Network, Swift source,
       USR `c:@Ea@nw_browse_result_change_invalid@nw_browse_result_change_identical`.
       `Ea` is clang's USR prefix for "enum anonymous"; this is an
       anonymous-enum member being extracted as a standalone constant.
       Arguably the fix here is to *not* emit anonymous-enum members
       as constants in the first place.
    3. `NEFilterFlowBytesMax` in NetworkExtension, and
       `CoreSpotlightAPIVersion` in CoreSpotlight. Both *are* correctly
       placed in `swift.skipped_symbols` at the extract-swift stage
       — I verified this in `collection/ir/collected/{NetworkExtension,CoreSpotlight}.json`.
       But they appear as live constants in the `resolved/`,
       `annotated/`, and `enriched/` IR. Somewhere between collected
       and resolved (or perhaps in the merge step of extract-swift
       itself, since the collected JSON is already post-merge),
       a filtered symbol is being promoted back into the constants
       list. `build_resolved_framework` in `analysis/crates/resolve/src/checkpoint.rs`
       only clones `collected` and populates class fields — it does
       not touch constants — so the leak is upstream of that.

  I reverted the harness extension (both the `REQUIRED_FRAMEWORKS` and
  `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS` additions) so the harness stays green, marked
  the original task as `blocked`, and added a new high-priority
  backlog entry "Non-linkable symbol leaks beyond the `c:@macro@`
  filter" (category: `[collection]`) with all four diagnostic
  findings written up. This is exactly the "discover what needs doing
  by doing adjacent things" pattern the backlog-plan spec describes —
  a supposedly-trivial coverage extension surfaced a real collection-level
  regression.

- **Task 13 (consolidate `needs_structs` helpers).** Pure refactor.
  Introduced `any_struct_type<'a, I>(type_refs: I, mapper: &dyn FfiTypeMapper) -> bool`
  in `shared_signatures.rs`. Rewrote `class_has_struct_types` to build
  its type-ref iterator inline and delegate; rewrote
  `generate_functions_file` and `generate_constants_file` similarly and
  deleted the standalone `functions_need_structs` and
  `constants_need_structs` helpers. No behavioural change; all 77 lib
  tests and 3 snapshot tests pass unchanged. The memory entry about
  "update three sites in lockstep" is now fixed at the code level —
  the iterator-construction lives with each caller but the struct
  check lives in one place. (Note: the underlying "what counts as a
  geometry struct" decision was already centralized in
  `emit/src/ffi_type_mapping.rs::is_known_geometry_struct`, so adding
  a new geometry cstruct only ever required one allowlist update
  anyway — the three-site coupling was more theoretical than the
  memory entry implied.)

- **Task 11 (tighten per-class method wrapper contracts) — partial.**
  Implemented item 1 "self tightening": added a `SELF_CONTRACT`
  constant (`"objc-object?"`) in `emit_class.rs` and routed
  instance-method contracts, instance-property getters, and
  instance-property setters through it. `objc-object?` is exported
  from `runtime/objc-base.rkt` and re-exported by `coerce.rkt`, so
  it is already in scope in every emitted class wrapper — no
  runtime change required. Updated 5 unit tests and regenerated
  snapshot goldens (`UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`). Runtime load harness
  re-run with `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1`: libraries via
  `dynamic-require` all pass, sample apps via `raco make` all
  compile. Total runtime 38s — no regression from baseline.

  **What self tightening actually catches.** Previously any Racket
  value would satisfy the self contract (`any/c`); a user passing a
  number or string or `#f` or a stale cpointer would get a generic
  failure deep inside `coerce-arg` or, worse, a segfault/PAC trap
  inside `objc_msgSend`. Now the contract boundary rejects
  non-`objc-object?` values immediately with blame on the caller.
  This is a direct answer to the Modaliser-Racket Task 1 complaint
  "bindings silently accept wrong types" for the most common misuse
  case.

  **What I deliberately did not tighten.** Items 2 (nullable `_id`
  params), 3 (class-specific predicates), 4 (Selector / `sel?`) are
  left as residual sub-items on the same task. Item 2 as spec'd
  literally (`(or/c any/c #f)`) is a semantic no-op; a better
  version (`(or/c string? objc-object? cpointer? [#f])` mirroring
  `coerce-arg`'s accept list) is available and would be pure win,
  but requires touching `map_param_contract` to consult
  `type_ref.nullable` and would shift every object-typed param in
  every snapshot — a full regeneration pass worth scheduling
  independently. Item 3 is marked stretch. Item 4 needs a runtime
  decision (expose a `sel?` alias, or accept `cpointer?` as the
  permanent contract). All three are captured in the task's
  "Residual sub-items" section in backlog.md.

- **Key learnings.**
  - The "run four cheap tasks in a row" pattern works well when
    at least one of them is a real refactor or win. The three
    cleanup tasks would have been 15 minutes each in isolation;
    batching them with 11 and 13 gave me a natural place to push
    until the context budget tightened.
  - The harness-catches-real-bugs outcome from Task 12 is exactly
    the standing-rule validation for memory.md's "Runtime loading
    is the real acceptance test" entry. The same class of cascade
    (fix one filter gap, discover the next) applies to filter
    families, not just emission-site bugs.
  - `objc-object?` being already-in-scope in every class wrapper
    (via `coerce.rkt` re-exporting from `objc-base.rkt`) is a
    small but load-bearing architectural choice. It meant the
    self tightening was a one-line constant change in the emitter
    rather than a runtime-side refactor plus emitter change.
  - The memory entry "Consolidating the three `needs_structs`
    helpers into one shared utility is a latent refactor"
    overstated the risk: the geometry-struct decision was already
    centralized in the FFI mapper. The real duplication was
    boilerplate, not decision drift. Worth refining in the next
    reflect cycle.

### Session N (2026-04-14T23:16:41Z) — fix class-method property setter arity mismatch
- **Attempted:** the high-priority Modaliser-Racket blocker "Class-method
  property accessors drop self-arg in contract but not impl". The bug: every
  class-method (static) property setter emitted a 1-arg `provide/contract`
  entry but a 2-arg impl (`(define (name self value) ...)`), so
  `provide/contract` rejected the binding at module load with
  `broke its own contract / accepts: 2 arguments`. NSMenuItem and NSPanel
  were the canaries from Modaliser startup.
- **Diagnosis refinement.** The backlog claimed *both* getter and setter
  were wrong. Inspection of freshly-regenerated `nsmenuitem.rkt` showed the
  getter was already correct (zero-arg impl at line 262-263 matching its
  `(c-> boolean?)` contract); only the setter diverged. Root cause was
  narrower than reported: `emit_property` in
  `generation/crates/emit-racket-oo/src/emit_class.rs` checked
  `prop.class_property` in both getter branches but *never* in any of its
  three setter branches (`_id` tell path, shared `_msg-N` path, fallback
  inline msgSend). Contracts at `build_export_contracts:321-325` correctly
  dropped `self` for `class_property` — the impl side was the divergence.
- **What worked:**
  - **TDD**: wrote two new unit tests
    (`test_class_property_setter_impl_and_contract_agree`,
    `test_class_property_getter_impl_and_contract_agree`) before touching
    emission. Setter test failed as expected showing
    `(define (... self value)`; getter test passed immediately (confirms
    the getter was always correct). Added `make_test_class_property`
    helper mirroring the existing `make_test_property`.
  - **Minimal fix**: threaded `prop.class_property` through all three
    setter branches as `params` and `target` locals. Class-property
    setters now emit `(define (name value) ...)` with `class_name`
    substituted for `(coerce-arg self)` as the tell/msgSend target.
  - **Regeneration**: `cargo run --bin apianyware-macos-generate
    -- --lang racket-oo` rebuilt all 7,046 files. Verified
    `nsmenuitem-set-uses-user-key-equivalents!` and
    `nspanel-set-allows-automatic-window-tabbing!` both emit `(define
    (... value)` without `self`, matching their contracts.
  - **Harness extension**: added `generated/oo/appkit/nsmenuitem.rkt`
    to `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS` in
    `tests/runtime_load_test.rs` as a permanent canary for this
    regression class. Documented the rationale in the slice comment
    (dimension 7). `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1 cargo test ...runtime_load_test`
    passes: all 7 libraries load, all 3 apps build via `raco make`,
    ~40s runtime.
  - `cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo` fully green: 82
    unit tests (including the 2 new class-property tests), 3 snapshot
    tests, 2 runtime load tests.
- **What didn't:** nothing actively failed; one mild false start: I
  initially worried my change was producing the entire testkit golden
  diff. Verification (`git grep 'class_property: true'` plus stashing
  the goldens and re-running snapshots at HEAD) confirmed the testkit
  goldens were already stale before my change — 100% of that diff comes
  from the pre-existing uncommitted emitter rewrite noted in the "Fix
  stale goldens" task. TestKit's synthetic fixtures contain no
  class-method properties, so the setter fix itself produces zero
  testkit-golden drift.
- **What this suggests next:**
  - The Modaliser-Racket startup path should now load past
    `nsmenuitem.rkt`/`nspanel.rkt` once it re-symlinks against the
    regenerated bindings. Worth a cross-project verification ping but
    out-of-scope for the work phase.
  - **Generalisable lesson** (candidate memory entry): when extending
    any emitter dimension that touches Apple-specific metadata (class
    methods, class properties, platform-availability, deprecation, …),
    add a real-framework canary to `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS` at the same
    time the dimension is added — don't wait for a downstream consumer
    to trip over it. TestKit's minimal synthetic fixture set is
    deliberately narrow and cannot model the full combinatorial
    surface of real frameworks.
  - The "Fix stale `snapshot_racket_oo_foundation_subset` golden files"
    task remains blocked on the emitter rewrite landing; this session
    did not touch it. The regenerated testkit goldens sit in the
    working tree, green against current source but unrelated to the
    class-property fix.
- **Key learnings / discoveries:**
  - The backlog entry's "getters also affected" claim was slightly
    wrong. Next time, verify load failures against the *exact* file
    line before assuming symmetry — even in a backlog written 12h ago
    by a prior-cycle triager.
  - The contract↔impl arity divergence is invisible to snapshot tests
    in both directions (text-level) and invisible to runtime load
    checks too *unless* a canary class with class-method properties
    is in `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS`. Memory's "load is the real acceptance
    test" rule applies here, but with a twist: "real" means "real
    frameworks with real Apple-specific metadata", not just "loads in
    Racket".
  - Fix option selection ("make contract match impl" vs "make impl
    match contract") depends entirely on which side is already
    correct. With the getter already zero-arg-correct, option 2
    (adjust the impl) was the only non-regressive choice — option 1
    would have introduced a pointless `self` slot where the getter
    didn't have one.

### Session N (2026-04-15T00:16:06Z) — Commit accumulated WIP

- **Attempted:** "Commit accumulated emitter changes" task. Verified WIP
  coherence, ran `cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo`, ran
  `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1` harness (~40s), ran full `cargo test --workspace`,
  staged, committed, pushed to origin/main.

- **What worked:**
  - All workspace tests green before commit (emit-racket-oo alone: 79
    unit + 3 snapshot + 2 runtime-load tests; foundation subset now
    green at HEAD).
  - `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1 cargo test --test runtime_load_test` green —
    7 library `dynamic-require` checks plus `raco make` of 3 sample
    apps. Harness actually ran (not the trivial pass-through you get
    when the env var is absent).
  - Commit f7a906c landed cleanly, pushed 3e13d37..f7a906c to
    origin/main.
  - Added two `.gitignore` rules up front so `compiled/` bytecode
    caches and `LLM_STATE/**/compact-baseline` scratch files stayed
    out of the commit.
  - "Fix stale foundation goldens" task resolved as a free side effect
    — the availability-filter delta and the emitter rewrite drift
    regenerated together in one pass, making the previously-anticipated
    follow-up commit unnecessary.

- **What didn't:** Nothing broke. One friction point: the backlog task
  was framed as "emitter changes" but the actual WIP spanned 120 files
  across collection, analysis, generation, runtime, apps, goldens,
  tests, docs, and LLM_STATE rotation. The honest scope of the commit
  message reflects this. Slicing into smaller commits was considered
  and rejected: `types/ir.rs`, the new `skipped_symbol_reason` enum,
  and `shared_signatures` drift thread through all three phases, so
  any partial slice would either break compilation or leave coupled
  changes in separate commits.

- **Suggests trying next:**
  - **File Lister app** is the next high-value task — it's the first
    of the 4 remaining sample apps and the delegate-pattern precondition
    for Text Editor. The working tree is now clean so any golden drift
    from app work surfaces without noise.
  - **Alternative: Tighten `_id` parameter contracts** (nullable
    marking) — lower scope, but forces another `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` cycle
    and would churn every class-wrapper snapshot. Worth scheduling
    back-to-back with "Class-specific runtime predicates" so one
    regeneration pass absorbs both.
  - **Low-hanging:** "Add `audiotoolbox/constants.rkt` to runtime load
    harness" (~1 hour of focused work, closes one canary gap on the
    open `c:@<name>` leak class).

- **Key learnings:**
  - The 2026-04-14 work phase's investigation of "stale foundation
    goldens" correctly predicted that the availability-filter delta
    was the clean slice, but was wrong to anticipate splitting it off
    as a follow-up commit. The cross-cutting type changes made
    slicing harder than it looked.
  - The run-backlog-plan.sh harness produces two new kinds of
    untracked state per run: `compiled/` caches inside any app the
    harness `raco make`s, and `LLM_STATE/**/compact-baseline` scratch
    files. Both should be gitignored (now are).
  - `ctx_read` and native `Read` have separate file-state tracking in
    the harness — editing after `ctx_read` requires an explicit native
    `Read` first. Noted for future work phases.

### Session N (2026-04-15T00:35:56Z) — Tighten `_id` param contracts with nullable marking

- **Attempted:** Replace the `any/c` fall-through in `map_param_contract`
  for `TypeRefKind::Class | Id | Instancetype` with a union that mirrors
  `coerce-arg`'s accepted set in `runtime/coerce.rkt`, consulting
  `type_ref.nullable` to choose between the 3-element non-nullable
  variant and the 4-element nullable variant.
- **Worked:**
  - TDD unit tests landed first (4 new + 1 updated): nullable `Id`,
    non-nullable/nullable `Class`, and `Instancetype` all produce the
    expected union strings.
  - Implementation in `emit_class.rs` is a single match-arm rewrite;
    blocks and primitives delegate unchanged.
  - Two pre-existing tests (`test_property_setter_contract`,
    `test_class_property_setter_impl_and_contract_agree`) needed their
    expected strings updated — both caught by the unit-test pass
    before snapshot rerun.
  - `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` regenerated 25 golden files (2 TestKit + 12
    Foundation + 11 AppKit). Spot-checked tkview and nsbutton
    diffs — nullable variant appears on `_id` setters where the
    extractor marked the property nullable, non-nullable variant on
    constructor params like `make-nsbutton-init-with-coder`.
  - `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1` harness green in ~40s: 7 library
    `dynamic-require` checks + `raco make` of all 3 sample apps.
    Contract tightening loads cleanly end-to-end.
  - Full `cargo test -p apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo`: 82 lib + 3
    snapshot + 2 runtime-load, all green.
- **Didn't work / surprises:**
  - The backlog description said the function lives in
    `emit_functions.rs`, but `map_param_contract` actually lives in
    `emit_class.rs` (emit_functions has its own `map_contract` for C
    FFI boundaries). Easy fix, but worth noting in the backlog entry.
  - Initial snapshot rerun before updating the two pre-existing tests
    surfaced them — the lib test stage would have caught them anyway,
    so order didn't matter, but the correct workflow is lib-test first
    to get a fast signal before the 1.3s snapshot pass.
- **Suggests next:**
  - The stretch "Class-specific runtime predicates" task is the
    natural follow-on: it touches `map_return_contract` (currently
    `any/c` for object returns) and would benefit from running soon
    so its snapshot churn can amortise against the freshly-updated
    goldens rather than collecting drift from unrelated changes.
  - The small unblocked "Add `audiotoolbox/constants.rkt` to runtime
    load harness" task is still sitting — zero-risk, ~1 min of
    real work, high signal on the remaining `c:@<name>` macro filter
    class.
- **Key learnings:**
  - Fresh AppKit IR already carries correct `_Nullable`/`_Nonnull`
    flags from the extractor — the tightening exercises real SDK
    annotations end-to-end, not just synthetic TestKit.
  - Getters stayed on `any/c` because `map_return_contract` is a
    separate function; scoping the change to params only kept the
    diff clean and leaves a clear follow-on task for returns.
  - Contract boundary catches that used to surface as deep
    `coerce-arg` errors now surface at the wrapper with caller blame —
    the ergonomics-neutral framing in the task description held up.

### Session N (2026-04-15T04:53:46Z) — File Lister polish + sample-app bundling

- **Attempted:** Polish the File Lister app that landed earlier this day
  (structural-only), then generalise the bundling story so every sample
  app ships as a proper macOS `.app` with the right menu-bar identity
  and the standard About/Hide/Quit menu items. Also wire up
  GUIVisionVMDriver (successor to TestAnyware) for interactive VM
  verification with OCR-capable VNC.

- **Worked:**
  - **File Lister polish iterations (all verified visually in the VM):**
    - Row height 20pt + `nstablecolumn-set-editable! #f` per column
      → clean read-only list rendering, no double-click-to-edit.
    - `NSStackView` horizontal + `NSLayoutAttributeFirstBaseline` for
      the toolbar → button title and path label baselines pin via
      Auto Layout instead of manual y-arithmetic (which kept landing
      half a pixel off across font sizes).
    - Scroll view flush to window edges (`(0,0,600,348)`, NSNoBorder);
      table autoresizing mask + `NSTableViewFirstColumnOnlyAutoresizingStyle`
      so the Name column absorbs horizontal growth on resize.
    - Autoresizing masks on the stack view (`NSViewWidthSizable |
      NSViewMinYMargin`) so the toolbar pins to the top during
      window resize.
  - **New crate `apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo`** at
    `generation/crates/bundle-racket-oo/`:
    - `AppSpec::from_script_name("file-lister")` → derives display
      name via kebab→title, or reads `knowledge/apps/<script>/spec.md`
      first H1 for canonical capitalisation (fixes
      `ui-controls-gallery` → `UI Controls Gallery`, not `Ui…`).
    - `collect_dependencies(entry, source_root)` — pure-Rust BFS
      walker over `.rkt` `(require "...rkt")` forms with a state-
      machine string literal scanner; rejects require targets
      outside `source_root`; handles cycles and escaped quotes.
    - `bundle_app(spec, source_root, output_dir)` — calls
      `stub-launcher::create_app_bundle` for the `.app` skeleton,
      then copies discovered files into
      `Resources/racket-app/<rel>` preserving the source layout so
      relative requires resolve at runtime. Optional
      `lib/libAPIAnywareRacket.dylib` is copied if present.
    - CLI: `cargo run --example bundle_app -p
      apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo -- <script>` or `-- --all`.
      `--all` walks `apps/` and bundles every entry.
    - 19 unit tests + 4 integration tests (including
      `bundles_every_sample_app` which auto-discovers new apps).
  - **Shared `runtime/app-menu.rkt` helper** exposing
    `install-standard-app-menu!`. Every sample app now calls it with
    its display name to install the standard About / Hide / Hide
    Others / Show All / Quit menu with the expected ⌘Q, ⌘H, ⌥⌘H
    keyboard equivalents. Uses raw typed `objc_msgSend` (not `tell`)
    because `tell` fails its `_id` coercion on SEL arguments like
    the `action:` slot of `addItemWithTitle:action:keyEquivalent:`.
  - **Latent `as-id` bug fixed** in `runtime/objc-base.rkt`. The
    `(objc-object? obj)` branch was returning the raw cpointer
    instead of `(cast … _pointer _id)`, making the function useless
    for its stated purpose. Surfaced when `install-standard-app-menu!`
    tried to pass the NSApplication wrapper through `as-id` and
    crashed the launch with `id->C: argument is not 'id' pointer`.
  - **All four sample apps bundle and run correctly:** hello-window
    (Hello Window.app), counter (Counter.app), ui-controls-gallery
    (UI Controls Gallery.app), file-lister (File Lister.app). Each
    has the correct `CFBundleName`, `app:"<Display Name>"` in the
    accessibility tree, and the full standard menu confirmed via
    VNC click + OCR screenshot of Counter's open menu.
  - **Testing:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → exit 0,
    484 passes, 0 failures. `RUNTIME_LOAD_TEST=1 cargo test -p
    apianyware-macos-emit-racket-oo --test runtime_load_test` green.
    `runtime/app-menu.rkt` added to `RUNTIME_FILES` in the harness;
    `APPS` now includes all 4 sample apps.
  - **Docs:** README updated with a new two-tier "App Bundling"
    section (stub-launcher language-agnostic primitive vs
    bundle-racket-oo racket-oo convention), GUI Testing section
    rewritten around GUIVisionVMDriver, workspace structure listing
    updated. `knowledge/targets/racket-oo.md` gets sections on
    sample-app bundling, delegate-callback type caveats (NSInteger
    return via arm64 x0 smuggle, raw-cpointer args), toolbar
    baseline alignment, and 2026-04-15 dated discoveries.
  - **Memory:** new entries for bundling, `app-menu.rkt` raw
    msgSend approach, `as-id` cast bug, accessibility menu
    drill-down via VNC click, GUIVisionVMDriver VNC password
    recovery.
  - **`.gitignore`:** `generation/targets/*/apps/*/build/` added
    (built bundles are regenerable via the CLI).

- **Didn't work first time / corrected:**
  - **First attempt at app-menu.rkt used `tell`** with SEL
    arguments. Failed at runtime with `id->C: argument is not 'id'
    pointer` on `addItemWithTitle:action:keyEquivalent:`. Rewrote
    using raw typed `objc_msgSend` — works cleanly.
  - **First bundling attempt hardcoded the Resources layout**
    incorrectly (`Resources/racket-app/<everything>`), which broke
    relative requires. Fixed by placing runtime and generated as
    siblings of `racket-app/` → script at
    `Resources/racket-app/apps/<name>/<name>.rkt`, deps at
    `Resources/racket-app/runtime/` and
    `Resources/racket-app/generated/oo/…`.
  - **First `AppSpec::from_script_name` used kebab→title conversion**
    and produced `Ui Controls Gallery`. Fixed by reading
    `knowledge/apps/<script>/spec.md`'s first H1 — spec.md is now
    the source of truth for canonical display names.
  - **`NSProcessInfo setProcessName:` hack didn't work** (modern
    macOS filters it). The bundling story is the only working fix
    for the menu-bar app name — that's why bundle-racket-oo exists
    at all.
  - **Bundle integration test assertions drifted** twice as the
    require tree changed (first when `nsstring.rkt` turned out not
    to be statically required, then when the app-menu helper stopped
    pulling in `nsmenu.rkt`/`nsmenuitem.rkt`). Each correction
    tightened the test with a positive "this IS pulled in" + a
    negative "this is NOT pulled in" assertion, which makes the
    test both a structural check and a change detector.

- **Suggests trying next:**
  - **Auto-bundling from the generate CLI:** teach
    `apianyware-macos-generate -- --lang racket-oo` to bundle the
    sample apps as a post-emission step. Currently opt-in via the
    bundle-racket-oo example. Out of scope this session but the
    primitive is in place.
  - **Menu Bar Tool app is next in the declared order** (now that
    all existing apps are polished and bundled). The shared menu
    helper will apply cleanly; the open challenge is the
    no-main-window status-bar lifecycle.
  - **Per-language bundle convention crates for chez/gerbil/etc.**
    follow the same split as bundle-racket-oo: dependency-walker
    tailored to the language's require semantics, plus a layout
    convention that keeps relative imports working inside the
    bundle. The stub-launcher primitive is language-agnostic.

- **Key learnings / discoveries:**
  - **The bundling story is non-optional** for a polished Mac sample
    app. `NSProcessInfo setProcessName:` doesn't work. Main-menu
    submenu titles handle the menu items but not the bold app-name
    slot. `CFBundleName` in `Info.plist` is the only path. That
    makes `bundle-racket-oo` a load-bearing crate, not a nicety.
  - **`tell` can't be used with SEL parameters**, period — raw
    typed `objc_msgSend` is the escape hatch, and the generated
    framework bindings already use it for every non-id parameter.
    Runtime-side helper code that needs SEL args must follow the
    same pattern.
  - **`as-id` had a silent bug for a long time** because nothing
    important was calling it with a wrapped `objc-object`. All the
    hot paths go through `coerce-arg` which has its own cast. The
    `install-standard-app-menu!` integration surfaced it by being
    the first runtime-side code to call `as-id` on an application
    handle. Lesson: utility functions with "always returns X"
    docstrings need unit tests, because callers trust the
    docstring.
  - **GUIVisionVMDriver agent + VNC split** is the right shape for
    this kind of verification. Agent snapshots give structural
    guarantees (the app's identity, what's in the accessibility
    tree). VNC `click` + `screenshot` fills the gaps (submenu
    contents, pixel alignment). The VNC password ephemerality is
    the main friction — source the vm-start script once with
    output to a file, persist the creds to `/tmp/gv_*` for
    subsequent calls.
  - **Spec.md as source of truth for display names** is a small
    but load-bearing convention. It means adding a new sample app
    is: create `apps/<kebab>/<kebab>.rkt`, create
    `knowledge/apps/<kebab>/spec.md` starting with `# <Display
    Name>`, and the bundler handles the rest. The integration
    test auto-discovers via directory walk, so no test edits are
    needed for a new app.

### Session N (2026-04-15T10:23:28Z) — Modaliser gap batch (Gaps 4,1,2 closed + Gap 3 design call)

- **Attempted:** The four Modaliser-Racket gaps from the "Coverage gaps
  discovered by Modaliser-Racket Task #7" backlog task, in the user-
  specified order 4 → 1 → 2 → 3, within a single work session.

- **What worked:**
  - **Gap 4 (CG enum empty stubs).** Root-cause diagnosis was
    straightforward once I compared CoreGraphics's `enums.rkt` (8
    defines, almost all bare `;; header` stubs) against Foundation's
    (212 defines, but only for anonymous enums). The anonymous-vs-named
    asymmetry pointed directly at the `CF_ENUM`/`NS_ENUM` macro
    expansion that produces both a forward decl and a definition with
    the same name. `seen_enums.insert(name)` guard let the empty
    forward-decl win; fix is a single `entity.is_definition()` check
    in the `EnumDecl` arm of `extract_declarations.rs`. Confirmed
    with a failing test first (`coregraphics_cgeventfield_enum_has_values`,
    `coregraphics_cgeventtype_enum_has_values`), then the fix turned
    them green. CoreGraphics `enums.rkt` 8→446 defines, Foundation
    212→1129, 63 extract-objc tests pass, snapshot goldens regenerated,
    runtime load harness green. All 10 Modaliser canary values present
    (`kCGEventKeyDown=10`, `kCGKeyboardEventKeycode=9`,
    `kCGHIDEventTap=0`, `kCGEventTapOptionDefault=0`, etc.).
  - **Gap 1 (HIServices AX functions).** Root cause: the framework
    filter in `is_from_framework` accepted only
    `System/Library/Frameworks/{Name}.framework/Headers/` and rejected
    every path from real nested subframeworks like HIServices (inside
    ApplicationServices). First attempt at a general fix (accept any
    path under `{Name}.framework/` that contains `/Headers/`) tripped
    a UTF-8 panic in the external `clang-2.0.0` crate during Quartz
    extraction. Narrowed the fix to a 1-item allowlist
    (`SUBFRAMEWORK_ALLOWLIST = &["ApplicationServices"]`) with a
    comment explaining why Quartz isn't included. libclang
    canonicalises symlinked subframeworks (CoreGraphics, CoreText,
    ColorSync, ImageIO) to their top-level paths, so they don't get
    double-counted. Pipeline now emits 384 ApplicationServices
    functions (up from 0), all 9 Modaliser AX symbols present
    (`AXIsProcessTrusted`, `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue`,
    `AXValueCreate`, etc.) plus 25 kAX* constants. New integration
    test `extract_applicationservices.rs` covers both the AX-present
    assertion and the no-CG/CT-leak assertion. Runtime load harness
    extended: `applicationservices/functions.rkt` now in
    `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS`, `ApplicationServices` in `REQUIRED_FRAMEWORKS`.
  - **Gap 2 (libdispatch/pthread).** New synthetic-pseudo-framework
    pattern: checked-in umbrella header at
    `collection/crates/extract-objc/synthetic-frameworks/libdispatch/libdispatch.h`
    pulls `<dispatch/dispatch.h>` and `<pthread.h>`; `sdk.rs` appends
    a synthetic `FrameworkInfo` via a new `synthetic_frameworks()`
    helper; `is_from_framework` branches on `libdispatch` name and
    accepts `usr/include/dispatch/` + `usr/include/pthread*` paths.
    Emitter-side hookup: new `shared_signatures::framework_ffi_lib_arg`
    helper dispatches by framework name —
    `libdispatch → "libSystem"` because the `libdispatch` short name
    doesn't resolve via dyld but `libSystem` does (dispatch symbols
    are re-exported there on modern macOS). 218 functions + 17
    constants extracted; all 5 Modaliser-required symbols
    (`dispatch_async_f`, `dispatch_after_f`, `dispatch_time`,
    `pthread_main_np`, `_dispatch_main_q`) present.
    `is_libdispatch_unexported` skip list filters 5 header-declared
    but dylib-missing symbols (`dispatch_cancel`, `dispatch_notify`,
    `dispatch_testcancel`, `dispatch_wait`,
    `pthread_jit_write_with_callback_np`) at emit time. End-to-end
    verification: `(dispatch_time 0 1000000000)` returns a sensible
    uint64; `(pthread_main_np)` returns `1`; `_dispatch_main_q` reads
    as a non-null cpointer. Runtime load harness extended to include
    both `libdispatch/functions.rkt` and `libdispatch/constants.rkt`.
  - **Gap 3 (libobjc runtime) — design call.** Chose Option B (curated
    `runtime/dynamic-class.rkt` hand-written bridge) over Option A
    (mechanical synthetic-framework emission of libobjc). Rationale
    recorded in the backlog Results field, in a new memory entry, and
    in this session log: libdispatch is a small flat linkage-level
    surface where mechanical extraction is clean, but libobjc is the
    ObjC introspection API — hundreds of polymorphic opaque-handle
    primitives already partially covered by Racket's built-in
    `ffi/unsafe/objc`. Mechanically emitting libobjc would create an
    unclear parallel API. Dynamic class creation is rare; a ~40-line
    curated bridge is the right granularity. Implementation split
    into its own follow-up task.

- **What didn't work / had to back out:**
  - First attempt at Gap 1's fix was too broad — accepting any
    `{Name}.framework/` path containing `/Headers/`. This tripped a
    pre-existing UTF-8 panic in the `clang-2.0.0` crate when visiting
    a Quartz subframework during a full collect run. Backed out to a
    narrow allowlist; Quartz's zero-functions count is unchanged.
  - First choice of `libdispatch` as the ffi-lib argument failed: the
    short name doesn't resolve via dyld's shared cache on macOS, even
    though the symbols do exist in libSystem. Switched to the
    `libSystem` short name.
  - libdispatch headers declare 218 functions but 5 of them aren't
    actually exported by the live dylib. First load attempt failed
    at the first missing symbol (`dispatch_cancel`). Wasn't willing
    to thread a runtime dlsym probe through the Rust extractor this
    session; filtered the 5 known-missing symbols at emit time via
    a hardcoded list with a clear comment explaining the verification
    strategy (the runtime load harness catches regressions).

- **Suggests trying next:**
  - **Menu Bar Tool sample app** is now the next highest-leverage
    item — independent of the gap work, uses GCD main-thread
    dispatch helpers which now have real `dispatch_async_f` etc.
    bindings available (though Menu Bar Tool uses the existing
    `runtime/main-thread.rkt` bridge, not the generated libdispatch
    bindings directly).
  - Implement `runtime/dynamic-class.rkt` per the Option B decision.
    It's a ~40-line file and would let Modaliser drop its
    `panel-manager.rkt` hand-written libobjc FFI.
  - Fix the signed-vs-unsigned enum-constant-representation bug
    discovered during Gap 4: `kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout = -2` in
    the generated output should be `4294967294` because the
    underlying type is `uint32_t`. Affects any unsigned-underlying
    enum with values that have the top bit set. Filed as its own
    backlog task.
  - Consider expanding the subframework allowlist beyond
    `ApplicationServices` once we find a way to skip the Quartz
    UTF-8 panic. Candidates: Carbon, CoreServices.

- **Key learnings / discoveries:**
  - **The `is_definition()` dedup pattern applies to every
    forward-declarable libclang cursor kind.** StructDecl,
    ObjCInterfaceDecl, and ObjCProtocolDecl also have dedup-by-name
    guards in `extract_declarations.rs` that could, in principle,
    suffer the same forward-decl-shadows-definition bug. Haven't
    confirmed whether it bites in practice — existing tests are
    green — but it's worth a scan next time the extractor changes.
  - **`symbol declared in headers` ≠ `symbol exported from dylib`
    on macOS.** On the live dyld shared cache, 5/218 libdispatch
    header-declared symbols simply aren't there. Snapshot tests
    can't see this; only the runtime load harness can. When adding
    new framework coverage, always run the harness before declaring
    victory.
  - **libclang canonicalises symlinked subframeworks to their
    top-level path.** This is the load-bearing observation that made
    the subframework-allowlist fix safe: ColorSync, CoreGraphics,
    CoreText, ImageIO are all symlinks inside ApplicationServices,
    but their declarations appear at the top-level paths, not the
    symlinked paths. Only genuinely-non-symlinked subframeworks
    (HIServices, ATS, PrintCore) need the allowlist to gain entry.
  - **Running the full pipeline is mandatory after source changes.**
    The existing memory entry "Regenerate pipeline aggressively" was
    load-bearing this session. Every gap required a full collect →
    analyze → generate cycle and runtime load harness run; relying
    on cached checkpoints would have masked the UTF-8 panic and the
    dylib-unexported-symbols issue.
  - **Emitter-side and collection-side filters serve different
    audiences.** The emit-time
    `shared_signatures::is_libdispatch_unexported` filter is the
    right layer for "this symbol is header-declared but dylib-missing"
    because it's a macOS runtime fact, not an IR-level concern. A
    collection-level filter would require a Rust dlopen/dlsym probe
    per symbol, which is scope-creep. Keeping it in the emitter also
    makes the filter a single grep-able location for "what did we
    lie about?".

### Session N (2026-04-15T11:53:43Z) — five-task batch: dynamic-class, delegate int/long, unsigned enum fix, harness coverage

#### What was attempted
User-directed sequence of tasks 9, 5, 6, 7, 8 from the racket-oo backlog,
in that order, working through them one at a time with verification
between each.

#### What worked
- **Task 9 — `runtime/dynamic-class.rkt`.** New curated libobjc bridge at
  `generation/targets/racket-oo/runtime/dynamic-class.rkt`. Exports the
  minimal subclass-construction surface (`objc-get-class`,
  `allocate-subclass`, `add-method!`, `register-subclass!`,
  `get-instance-method`, `method-type-encoding`) plus the
  `make-dynamic-subclass` convenience that chains the three calls in
  the right order. Idempotent on duplicate names — returns the existing
  class instead of NULL-from-`objc_allocateClassPair`. Type aliases
  `_Class` / `_SEL` / `_Method` / `_IMP` exported for raw-msgSend
  consumers. Harness extended: file added to both `RUNTIME_FILES` and
  `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS`. Verified via runtime load harness in 14.8s.

- **Task 5 — `'int` / `'long` delegate return kinds.** Two layers
  changed in lockstep. Swift side
  (`swift/Sources/APIAnywareRacket/DelegateBridge.swift`): 8 new IMP
  trampolines (`impInt0..3` returning `Int32`, `impLong0..3` returning
  `Int64`); `selectIMP` extended with `("int", N)` / `("long", N)`
  cases; `typeEncoding` extended with `int → "i"`, `long → "q"`.
  The `q` mapping is the load-bearing part — NSInteger is `long` on
  64-bit Apple platforms and clang encodes it as `q`, so `'long` is
  the correct kind for `numberOfRowsInTableView:` etc. Racket side
  (`generation/targets/racket-oo/runtime/delegate.rkt`): mirrored
  branches in `return-kind->string`, `make-delegate/swift`,
  `make-delegate/racket`, `delegate-set!`, plus new `type-encoding-int`
  / `type-encoding-long` helpers. 3 new Swift tests added
  (`setAndInvokeIntMethod` returning 42, `setAndInvokeLongMethod`
  returning `0x1_0000_0000 + 7` to prove no Int32 truncation,
  `defaultIntLongReturns` checking the unhandled default of 0); all 10
  `DelegateBridgeTests` pass. Runtime load harness still green
  (15.1s libraries, 46.8s full).

- **Task 6 — Unsigned enum sign-extension fix.** Fixed `extract_enum`
  in `collection/crates/extract-objc/src/extract_declarations.rs`. New
  `is_unsigned_int_kind` helper covers `CharU`, `UChar`, `UShort`,
  `UInt`, `ULong`, `ULongLong`, `UInt128`. The underlying type is
  canonicalised first via `enum_clang_type.get_canonical_type()` —
  essential for typedef-wrapped underlyings like `NSUInteger →
  unsigned long`. For unsigned-backed enums the loop reads the `.1`
  (u64) component and casts to i64 after a bounds check; values
  exceeding `i64::MAX` are skipped with `tracing::warn!` rather than
  wrapped silently (the IR schema is i64; a silent flip would be
  worse than a missing constant). Regression test in
  `tests/extract_coregraphics.rs::coregraphics_cgeventtype_unsigned_top_bit_values_not_sign_extended`
  asserts `kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout == 0xFFFFFFFE_i64` and
  `kCGEventTapDisabledByUserInput == 0xFFFFFFFF_i64`. All 66
  extract-objc tests still green.

- **Task 7 — AudioToolbox harness coverage.** Two-line extension to
  `runtime_load_test.rs`: `"AudioToolbox"` added to
  `REQUIRED_FRAMEWORKS`; `"generated/oo/audiotoolbox/constants.rkt"`
  added to `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS`. Confirms the 2026-04-13 closure of
  "Platform-unavailable extern symbols leak" holds against fresh IR.
  Harness library check still ~14.6s.

- **Task 8 — 3-framework harness re-attempt.** Re-ran the previously
  reverted 2026-04-13 extension. Added `Network`, `NetworkExtension`,
  `CoreSpotlight` to `REQUIRED_FRAMEWORKS` and
  `networkextension/constants.rkt`, `network/constants.rkt`,
  `corespotlight/constants.rkt` to `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS`. All four
  previously-failing checks (including the audiotoolbox one from
  Task 7) now pass cleanly. Total `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS` entries now
  15 (was 10); total `REQUIRED_FRAMEWORKS` 10 (was 6).

#### What didn't / what was deferred
- File Lister's pointer-smuggle in `numberOfRowsInTableView:` could now
  be removed by switching to `:return-types #hash(("numberOfRowsInTableView:" . long))`.
  Not done in this session to keep Task 5's diff focused — flagged as a
  natural follow-up cleanup.
- Modaliser-Racket's `panel-manager.rkt` migration to use the new
  `make-dynamic-subclass` bridge is a separate Modaliser-Racket task,
  not in this project's scope.
- The unsigned-enum fix lands at extraction time, so the fix is only
  visible in generated `coregraphics/enums.rkt` after a fresh pipeline
  regeneration. Not regenerated this session — the test asserts on
  freshly-extracted IR via the test harness, which is the verification
  layer that matters.

#### What this suggests trying next
- File Lister NSInteger smuggle removal — small, isolates one app from
  the deprecated workaround pattern.
- Continue with Menu Bar Tool (the next sample app per the stated focus
  in the backlog header). Now unblocked by the integer-return-kind work
  for any timer callbacks that need int returns.
- Per Task 6's fix being at extraction time, schedule a pipeline
  regeneration before any task that depends on observing the corrected
  values in the generated `enums.rkt` files.

#### Key learnings
- **Clang's enum constant value tuple is signed/unsigned, not first/canonical.**
  `child.get_enum_constant_value()` returns `Option<(i64, u64)>` where
  `.0` is the signed interpretation and `.1` is the unsigned. The two
  bits agree for top-bit-clear values and diverge for top-bit-set ones.
  Unsigned-detection has to canonicalise the underlying type first
  (typedef expansion via `get_canonical_type()`) — without that step,
  every `NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, ...)` would slip through as a `Typedef`
  kind and miss the unsigned branch.
- **ObjC type encoding `q` is NSInteger on 64-bit.** NSInteger is
  `typedef long NSInteger` on 64-bit Apple platforms, and clang encodes
  `long` as `q` (not `l`) on those platforms. So `'long → "q"` in the
  delegate trampoline encoding is exactly the right mapping for the
  NSInteger-returning delegate methods that motivated the task — no
  separate `'nsinteger` kind needed.
- **The runtime load harness is the right place to extend coverage
  cheaply.** Adding a single `dynamic-require` check costs essentially
  nothing on top of the amortised Racket startup (the harness uses one
  subprocess for all checks). Adding 4 new frameworks took the library
  check from ~14.8s to ~15.1s — 0.3s for 4 fresh framework emissions
  plus 4 dynamic-requires. This means coverage extension should be
  reflexive whenever a new `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS` candidate appears,
  not gated on "is it worth the runtime cost?".
- **`make-dynamic-subclass` idempotence is load-order-critical.**
  `objc_allocateClassPair` returns NULL for duplicate names, which would
  crash subsequent `class_addMethod` calls. The bridge guards against
  this by returning the existing class via `objc_getClass` first. This
  matters for any module that registers a subclass at module load
  time and may be loaded twice in the same Racket VM.

### Session N (2026-04-16T02:58:09Z) — Fix radio-button contract violation + live GUI verification

- **Attempted:** Bug fixes 1 and 2 from the backlog. Task 1 was an audit
  (no code change). Task 2 required three iterations to find the correct
  fix, then live GUI verification in the GUIVisionVMDriver VM.

- **Task 1 — make-objc-block #f-guard audit:** Confirmed guard is live
  and fully test-covered (8/8 block tests pass). Guard landed in commit
  `f7a906c` (2026-04-15); Modaliser report was 2026-04-16 (pre-guard
  checkout). Closed with no code change.

- **Task 2 — radio-button contract violation (3 iterations):**
  - **Attempt 1:** `(cast sender _pointer _id)` — fails. `objc-object?`
    is a struct predicate, not a cpointer tag check. Cast produces a
    tagged cpointer but not an `objc-object` struct.
  - **Attempt 2:** `(tell #:type _void (cast sender _pointer _id)
    setIntValue: 1)` — fails. `tell` types all params as `_id`; integer
    `1` gets rejected with `id->C: argument is not 'id' pointer`.
  - **Attempt 3 (final):** `(nsbutton-set-int-value!
    (wrap-objc-object (cast sender _pointer _id)) 1)` — works.
    `wrap-objc-object` creates the `objc-object` struct the contract
    requires. Default `#:retained #f` adds a balanced retain/release
    pair, safe for borrowed refs.

- **Live GUI verification in VM:**
  - Built bundle via `apianyware-macos-bundle-racket-oo`
  - Shipped to `guivision-default` VM via tar upload + SSH extract
  - Launched racket directly (unbundled) with stderr to `/tmp/ucg3.log`
  - Scrolled to radio buttons section (NSScrollView flipped coords —
    dy=+50 scrolls "up" to top of content in Cocoa unflipped space)
  - Clicked A→B, B→C, C→A: all transitions succeeded
  - Screenshots confirmed visual state changes (blue dot moves)
  - Error log empty, process stayed alive (pid 16418)

- **What worked:**
  - `wrap-objc-object` is the correct pattern for delegate callback args
    that need to pass through `provide/contract` boundaries
  - GUIVisionVMDriver VNC + SSH hybrid (agent was wedged, SSH bypassed)
  - Cached `compiled/` from prior runs made relaunch fast (~30s vs 5min)

- **What didn't work / caveats:**
  - GUIVisionVMDriver agent `exec` wedged after first session's commands;
    SSH was the reliable fallback
  - `(cast x _pointer _id)` does NOT satisfy `objc-object?` — this was
    a wrong assumption in the original backlog description
  - `tell` cannot send non-object parameters without typed dispatch
  - The backlog's "pattern identical to File Lister" claim was incorrect;
    File Lister's cast feeds into `tell`, not a contract boundary

- **Suggests next:**
  1. Task 3 (File Lister `'long` return-kind migration) — next cleanest
     cleanup, exercises the fresh `'long` delegate return kind.
  2. Factor `borrow-objc-object` into runtime if a third instance of the
     `wrap-objc-object` pattern appears (currently at 1 instance).
  3. Longer-term: delegate trampoline should pre-wrap `id`-typed args as
     `objc-object` structs to eliminate this bug class at the source.

- **Key learnings:**
  - `objc-object?` is `(struct objc-object ...)` predicate, not a
    cpointer tag check. Only `wrap-objc-object` and the struct
    constructor produce values satisfying it. `(cast x _pointer _id)`
    is necessary but not sufficient — it tags the pointer for FFI but
    doesn't create the struct wrapper.
  - `tell` defaults all parameters to `_id` type. Non-object parameters
    (int, float, bool, SEL) require the typed `_msg-N` dispatch pattern
    the generated wrappers use internally.
  - The `wrap-objc-object` with default `#:retained #f` is the safe
    idiom for "I have a borrowed pointer that needs to flow through an
    `objc-object?` contract": retain on wrap, release on GC, net zero.
  - NSScrollView in Cocoa's unflipped coordinates: `dy=+50` scrolls to
    reveal content near origin (top of document), contrary to the macOS
    natural scrolling mental model. Confirmed empirically.

### Session 17 (2026-04-16T04:21:32Z) — Modaliser Task #7b: delegate int/long, CF_ENUM fix, struct globals, libdispatch pointer types

- **What was attempted:** Six interconnected tasks from the Modaliser Task #7b batch — all completed:
  1. **Delegate `'int`/`'long` return kinds** — added Int32 and Int64 Swift trampolines (`impInt0–3`, `impLong0–3`) to `DelegateBridge.swift`, ObjC type encodings `"i"`/`"q"`, Racket FFI dispatch (`_int32`/`_int64`), default-returns (0), and three new Swift tests (`setAndInvokeIntMethod`, `setAndInvokeLongMethod`, `defaultIntLongReturns`).
  2. **`numberOfRowsInTableView:` pointer-smuggle removed** — `file-lister.rkt` migrated from `#:return-types (hash "numberOfRowsInTableView:" 'id)` + `(ptr-add #f count)` to `'long` return kind with `(length file-entries)` directly; updated comments to remove workaround explanation.
  3. **Struct-data-symbol emitter fix** — `emit_constants.rs`: `is_struct_data_symbol()` branches `ffi-obj-ref` for struct-typed globals (symbol address) vs `get-ffi-obj` for pointer-typed globals (symbol contents). Contract for struct globals is `cpointer?`. `needs_structs` computation excludes struct globals. 5 new unit tests. `shared_signatures.rs` gained `framework_ffi_lib_arg()` helper (also used by `generate_functions_file`).
  4. **libdispatch `_id`→`_pointer` override** — `emit_functions.rs`: when `framework == "libdispatch"`, `_id` FFI types become `_pointer` for both params and returns. `is_libdispatch_unexported()` added to filter symbols absent from `libSystem` at load time (5 symbols). 3 new unit tests.
  5. **Radio-button contract fix** — `ui-controls-gallery.rkt`: delegate sender arg now wrapped as `(wrap-objc-object (cast sender _pointer _id))` to satisfy `objc-object?` contract at the class-wrapper call site.
  6. **CF_ENUM forward-declaration shadowing fix** — `extract_declarations.rs`: `entity.is_definition()` guard prevents the forward decl (emitted by CF_ENUM/NS_ENUM macro expansion) from shadowing the populated definition in `seen_enums`. Golden files exploded: Foundation enums 212→1129, AppKit enums corrected; CoreGraphics enum stubs unblocked.
  7. **Unsigned enum extraction fix** — canonicalise `get_canonical_type()` before inspecting kind; unsigned-backed enums read `.1` (u64 component) instead of sign-extending `.0`. Top-bit-set values that don't fit in i64 are warned and skipped. New helper `is_unsigned_int_kind()`.
  8. **ApplicationServices subframework allowlist** — `is_from_framework` now also matches headers under the `.framework/` root (any `/Headers/` subpath) for frameworks on `SUBFRAMEWORK_ALLOWLIST = ["ApplicationServices"]`, enabling HIServices AX functions to be extracted without double-counting canonicalised subframeworks.
  9. **Synthetic pseudo-framework pattern** — `sdk.rs`: `discover_frameworks` appends `synthetic_frameworks()`, which returns a `FrameworkInfo` for `libdispatch` pointing to `synthetic-frameworks/libdispatch/libdispatch.h` inside the crate. The umbrella header was checked in as a new untracked directory.
  10. **Runtime load harness expanded** — `runtime_load_test.rs`: `dynamic-class.rkt` added to `RUNTIME_FILES`; `REQUIRED_FRAMEWORKS` grows 4→10 (AudioToolbox, CoreSpotlight, ApplicationServices, libdispatch, Network, NetworkExtension); `LIBRARY_LOAD_CHECKS` grows with 7 new entries (applicationservices/functions.rkt, libdispatch/functions.rkt, libdispatch/constants.rkt, audiotoolbox/constants.rkt, networkextension/constants.rkt, network/constants.rkt, corespotlight/constants.rkt, runtime/dynamic-class.rkt).
  11. **Collection tests** — `extract_coregraphics.rs`: 3 new tests — `CGEventField` has values, `CGEventType` has values, unsigned top-bit values not sign-extended (tests `kCGEventTapDisabledByUserInput` = 0xFFFFFFFF path).

- **What worked:** All tasks completed. `raco make` harness (15 libraries + 4 apps) passes. DelegateBridge Swift unit tests pass including the new int/long tests. `emit_constants` 18 tests + `emit_functions` 25 tests pass. Golden files regenerated and updated.

- **What this suggests trying next:** "Research: Transparent Object Wrapping for Delegate Callback Args" — the radio-button fix required 3 iterations, exposing that `wrap-objc-object` is correct but too intrusive for app authors. This is the next backlog task. Following that: File Lister GUI smoke via GUIVisionVMDriver.

- **Key learnings:**
  - CF_ENUM/NS_ENUM macros expand to two `EnumDecl` entities sharing one name: a forward declaration (no constants) then the populated definition. The `seen_enums` guard consumed the forward decl and shadowed the definition. `entity.is_definition()` is the fix; it is not enough to rely on `get_name()` being non-empty.
  - libclang sign-extends top-bit-set u64 values into the `i64` component of `get_enum_constant_value()`. For `CF_ENUM(uint32_t, ...)` types, the canonical underlying kind must be checked; use the `u64` component (`.1`) and range-check before casting.
  - `DISPATCH_GLOBAL_OBJECT` symbols like `_dispatch_main_q` are structs, not pointers: `get-ffi-obj` reads the first 8 bytes of the struct (a pointer field), not the symbol's address. `ffi-obj-ref` returns the address, which is what C callers use via `&_dispatch_main_q`. The IR already distinguishes struct vs pointer kind at the Clang AST level.
  - libdispatch dispatch object types (`dispatch_queue_t` etc.) appear as `_id` in the IR because headers use `OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=1`, but no ObjC wrapper classes exist for them. `_pointer` is the correct FFI type; the ABI is identical and consumers can pass raw cpointers from `ffi-obj-ref` without cast ceremony.
  - The delegate `'long` return kind closes the NSInteger gap cleanly — NSInteger on 64-bit Apple is `typedef long`, clang encodes it `"q"`, and the Int64 trampoline passes the value through without pointer-bit tricks.

### Session 18 (2026-04-16T05:01:02Z) — Research: FFI surface elimination + triage from Modaliser-Racket usage

- **What was attempted:** The original research task ("Transparent Object Wrapping for Delegate Callback Args") was expanded in scope to a comprehensive audit of every FFI concept leaking into app code. The session was entirely research and backlog maintenance — no Rust or Racket source files were modified.

- **What worked:**
  - Full FFI leakage catalog produced across all 4 sample apps (counter, file-lister, ui-controls-gallery, hello-window): 10 distinct categories identified (delegate args as raw cpointers, int/long pointer-encoded args, `ffi/unsafe` requires, `sel_registerName` for actions, `cpointer?` in contracts, `nsstring->string`/`string->nsstring`, `objc-object-ptr` unwrapping, `tell` with raw cast, `tell ... autorelease`, `objc-null?`/`objc-object?` checks).
  - Root causes narrowed to 3 systemic issues: (A) `delegate.rkt` trampolines are type-unaware, (B) `emit_protocol.rs:method_return_kind` discards param types and misclassifies int/long returns as void, (C) generated wrappers expose FFI vocabulary in contracts (SEL params as `cpointer?`).
  - 3-phase solution architecture designed: Phase 1 = `borrow-objc-object` + `#:param-types` on `make-delegate` + fix `method_return_kind` + emit param-type metadata; Phase 2 = selector params accept strings, drop `cpointer?`, add `->string`; Phase 3 = rewrite apps, verify in harness + VM.
  - "Selector parameter contracts" stretch task closed as subsumed by Phase 2a (stronger outcome: string args with internal `sel_registerName`, not just a `sel?` alias).
  - Latent runtime bug confirmed in `ui-controls-gallery.rkt`: slider/stepper callbacks pass raw `sender` cpointer to wrappers that have `objc-object?` contracts — will crash on any code path that executes those callbacks.
  - Three new "Bug Fixes and Cleanup" tasks captured from Modaliser-Racket real-world usage: `nsscreen.rkt` duplicate symbol (load error), `nsmenuitem.rkt` `+separatorItem` misclassified as instance property (not class method), `wkwebview.rkt` missing inherited `setAutoresizingMask:`.
  - Two new core backlog tasks: `make-objc-block` does not handle `#f` input (apply crash), and `is_definition()` guard audit for StructDecl/ObjCInterfaceDecl/ObjCProtocolDecl arms.

- **What didn't work:** Nothing attempted in code — session was research-only by design. The `borrow-objc-object` + `#:param-types` approach was chosen over contract relaxation and struct elimination on the basis of type safety and overhead trade-offs; implementation deferred to the FFI Surface Elimination task.

- **What this suggests trying next:** Begin FFI Surface Elimination Phase 1 in the next session: add `borrow-objc-object` to `objc-base.rkt`, then `#:param-types` to `make-delegate`, then fix `method_return_kind` in `emit_protocol.rs`, then emit param-type metadata from protocol IR. Phase 1 delivers the highest impact (invisible delegate arg handling) and unblocks the `ui-controls-gallery.rkt` latent bug fix.

- **Key learnings:**
  - The delegate trampoline type-unawareness is the single biggest FFI leakage source — every callback touching a wrapper requires manual `wrap-objc-object`+`cast` or `cast _pointer _int64`. Fixing this in `delegate.rkt` eliminates the most common friction point in one place.
  - `emit_protocol.rs:method_return_kind` has a silent correctness gap: int/long returns fall through to "void", so generated protocol factories misclassify NSInteger-returning methods. This went unnoticed because `raco make` compiles without executing callbacks.
  - Real-world Modaliser-Racket usage surfaced three emitter bugs not caught by the snapshot test suite: `nsscreen.rkt` duplicate symbol, `nsmenuitem.rkt` class-vs-instance method classification, and `wkwebview.rkt` missing inherited method — all three are load-time or API-surface failures invisible to golden-file diffs.
