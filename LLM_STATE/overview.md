# APIAnyware Status

At-a-glance view of the project. Updated at session boundaries.

## Plans

| Plan | Location | Run |
|------|----------|-----|
| Core Pipeline | `LLM_STATE/core/` | `./LLM_STATE/core/run.sh` |
| Racket OO Target | `LLM_STATE/targets/racket-oo/` | `./LLM_STATE/targets/racket-oo/run.sh` |

Each plan directory contains `plan.md` (backlog), `session-log.md` (history),
`memory.md` (distilled learnings), and `run.sh` (three-phase cycle driver).
See `LLM_CONTEXT/backlog-plan.md` for the phase cycle spec.

## Core Pipeline

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ObjC class collection | done | libclang-based, typedef resolution at extraction time |
| ObjC protocol collection | done | |
| ObjC enum collection | done | |
| C function collection | done | 858 CF, 777 CG, 186 Foundation, 676 Security |
| C enum/constant collection | done | VarDecl + EnumDecl; #define constants not captured |
| C callback type collection | done | FunctionPointer TypeRefKind with full signatures |
| Resolution (inheritance) | done | |
| Annotation (heuristic + LLM) | done | LLM step needs integration into CLI |
| Enrichment | done | per-framework verification fix applied, isolation tests added |

## Targets

| Target | Status | Styles | Apps Done | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| racket-oo | active | oo (done), functional (not started), c-api (blocked) | 3/7 | Next: remaining apps |
| racket-functional | not started | functional | 0/7 | Needs functional emitter |

## Cross-Cutting Blockers

- C-API style for all targets: core extraction done, needs C-API emitter implementation
- racket-functional style blocked on functional emitter implementation
- AppKit snapshot tests blocked on AppKit enriched IR
