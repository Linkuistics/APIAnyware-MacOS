# APIAnyware-MacOS Workspace Design

**Date:** 2026-03-26
**Status:** Draft
**Supersedes:** 2026-03-23-project-restructure-design.md (which covered a single monorepo approach)

## Purpose

Define the structure, naming, and inter-phase contracts for `APIAnyware-MacOS` — a Rust workspace that extracts, analyzes, and generates idiomatic language bindings for macOS platform APIs. This is the first platform in a family that will eventually include `APIAnyware-Windows` and `APIAnyware-Linux`, each as independent repos with their own workspaces.

The generation phase targets a broad set of languages: Racket, Chez Scheme, Gerbil Scheme, Common Lisp (SBCL, CCL), Haskell, Idris2, OCaml, Prolog, Mercury, Rhombus, Pharo Smalltalk, Zig, and others. Each target produces bindings idiomatic to that language's conventions — not a lowest-common-denominator C wrapper. Languages with both OO and functional idioms may produce multiple binding styles from the same enriched IR.

## Principles

1. **Phases communicate via files.** Each phase reads checkpoint files from the previous phase and writes its own. No in-memory coupling between phases.
2. **Checkpoints are resumable.** Expensive steps (especially LLM annotation) are not re-run unless their inputs change. Each checkpoint is a complete, self-contained JSON file per framework.
3. **Collection is mechanical.** It uses existing parsers (libclang, swift-api-extract) and is easy to get 100% right. It runs once per SDK update.
4. **Analysis improves over time.** Datalog rules and LLM annotations evolve independently. The checkpoint model allows iterating on either without re-running the other.
5. **Generation is per-language and idiomatic.** Each target language gets its own emitter crate and runtime support library. Bindings are shaped to the target language's idioms — not a thin veneer over C. Languages with multiple paradigms (e.g., OO + functional) may produce multiple binding styles from the same enriched IR.
6. **Framework discovery is automatic.** Tools scan the SDK or checkpoint directories — no manual framework lists needed for normal operation.
7. **LLM provider is flexible.** The annotation schema is the contract. Annotations can come from Claude Code sessions, cloud APIs, local models, or manual editing.
8. **Rich provenance from collection.** Every declaration carries source location, SDK version, availability attributes, documentation references, and Apple doc URLs. Generation uses these to produce cross-referenced documentation.

## Repository & Naming

**GitHub repo / local directory:** `APIAnyware-MacOS`

**Naming conventions:**
- GitHub repos and development directories: PascalCase hyphen-separated (`APIAnyware-MacOS`)
- Rust crate names: lowercase hyphen-separated (`apianyware-macos-extract-objc`)
- CLI binary names: lowercase hyphen-separated (`apianyware-macos-collect`, `apianyware-macos-analyze`)
- File paths and identifiers: lowercase hyphen-separated

**Future sibling repos:** `APIAnyware-Windows`, `APIAnyware-Linux` — independent workspaces with platform-specific parsers, memory models, and type systems. No shared crate across platforms initially; common abstractions extracted later if warranted.

## Shared Types Crate

`collection/crates/types/` (`apianyware-macos-types`) defines:

- **IR structs** — `Framework`, `Class`, `Method`, `Property`, `Protocol`, `Enum`, `Struct`, `Function`, `Constant`, `TypeRef`
- **Provenance** — `SourceProvenance` (header path, line, SDK version, availability)
- **Documentation references** — `DocRefs` (header comment, Apple doc URL, USR/symbol ID)
- **Annotation schema** — `MethodAnnotation`, `BlockInvocationStyle`, `OwnershipKind`, `ThreadingConstraint`, `ErrorPattern`, `AnnotationSource`
- **Checkpoint format** — serde `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for all types, JSON as the wire format
- **Null-safe deserialization** — handles Go-style `null` arrays from legacy IR

This crate has no dependencies beyond `serde` and `serde_json`. All other crates in the workspace depend on it.

---

## Phase 1: Collection

### ObjC/C Extraction (`extract` crate)

Uses the `clang` Rust crate (safe wrapper around libclang) to parse ObjC headers from the macOS SDK.

**Process:**
1. Discover SDK path via `xcrun --show-sdk-path`
2. Scan `{SDK}/System/Library/Frameworks/` for available frameworks
3. For each framework, locate the umbrella header (e.g., `Foundation/Foundation.h`)
4. Parse with libclang: `-x objective-c`, SDK include paths, deployment target flags
5. Walk the AST extracting declarations
6. Capture provenance: source file, line number, SDK version, availability attributes
7. Capture doc refs: header doc comments, compute Apple doc URL from USR
8. Write `ir/collected/{Framework}.json`

**What libclang provides:**
- Full AST with type information
- Nullability annotations (`_Nullable`, `_Nonnull`) from headers
- Availability attributes (`API_AVAILABLE`, `NS_DEPRECATED`)
- Documentation comments from headers
- USR (Unified Symbol Resolution) — stable symbol identifier
- Block parameter types fully resolved (no typedef aliasing problem)

### Swift Extraction (`extract-swift` crate)

Uses `swift-api-digester -dump-sdk` (ships with Xcode toolchain) to extract Swift API metadata as JSON.

**Process:**
1. Locate via `xcrun --find swift-api-digester`
2. For each framework with `.swiftmodule`, invoke `xcrun swift-api-digester -dump-sdk -module {Framework} -sdk $(xcrun --show-sdk-path) -o {output}.json`
3. Parse the `ABIRoot` JSON tree into IR types
4. Tag each declaration with `source: "swift_interface"`
5. Merge with ObjC declarations for the same framework (Swift extensions on ObjC classes)
6. Capture availability and doc comments from the Swift interface

**Output merging:** A single `ir/collected/{Framework}.json` per framework contains declarations from both ObjC headers and Swift interfaces. Each declaration carries a `source` field (`"objc_header"` or `"swift_interface"`) so downstream phases know which bridging pattern applies.

### CLI (`apianyware-macos-collect`)

```
apianyware-macos-collect                    # discover and extract all SDK frameworks
apianyware-macos-collect --only Foundation   # extract specific framework(s)
apianyware-macos-collect --list              # list available frameworks
```

---

## Phase 2: Analysis

### Resolve (`resolve` crate) — Datalog Pass 1

Reads `collection/ir/collected/` and computes derived relations via Datalog (ascent crate).

**Derived relations:**
- `ancestor(class, ancestor_class)` — transitive inheritance
- `effective_method(class, selector, ...)` — inheritance-flattened methods with override detection
- `effective_property(class, prop_name, ...)` — inheritance-flattened properties
- `returns_retained_method(class, selector, is_class_method)` — ownership family detection
- `satisfies_protocol_method(class, selector, protocol)` — protocol conformance

**Process:**
1. Discover all `*.json` in `collection/ir/collected/`
2. Load all frameworks (cross-framework dependencies resolved by loading all)
3. Run the ascent Datalog program
4. Write `analysis/ir/resolved/{Framework}.json` — collected data + derived relations

### Annotate (`annotate` crate) — Heuristics + LLM Merge

Reads `analysis/ir/resolved/` and adds semantic annotations.

**Heuristic classification (Rust, deterministic):**
- Block invocation style from selector naming (`enumerate` → sync, `completion` → async, `observer` → stored)
- Parameter ownership from naming (`delegate`/`dataSource` → weak)
- Threading from class identity (AppKit UI classes → main thread only)
- Error pattern from parameter signature (last param named `error` with pointer type → error_out_param)

**LLM annotation merge:**
- Reads existing `analysis/ir/annotated/{Framework}.json` if present
- Methods with `source: "llm"` or `source: "human_reviewed"` are preserved (LLM takes precedence)
- Methods without LLM annotations get heuristic-only annotations
- The LLM analysis is a separate step (Claude Code session, script, or manual) that writes to the same file

**Process:**
1. Discover all `*.json` in `analysis/ir/resolved/`
2. For each framework, run heuristics on all methods
3. Merge with existing LLM annotations (if the annotated checkpoint exists)
4. Write `analysis/ir/annotated/{Framework}.json`

### LLM Annotation (External Process)

Not part of the Rust codebase. The LLM reads resolved IR + Apple documentation and produces annotation JSON matching the schema.

**Invocation paths:**
- **Claude Code:** `/analyze` command discovers frameworks needing annotation and processes them
- **Script:** `analysis/scripts/llm-annotate.sh` calls any OpenAI-compatible API (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- **Manual:** Edit `analysis/ir/annotated/{Framework}.json` directly

All paths produce the same schema. The `annotate` crate's merge step integrates LLM output with heuristics regardless of how the LLM annotations were produced.

**The prompt template** (`analysis/scripts/prompt-template.md`) is the reusable asset. It describes the annotation schema, the method signature format, and what to look for in Apple documentation.

### Enrich (`enrich` crate) — Datalog Pass 2

Reads `analysis/ir/annotated/` and runs Datalog with annotation facts to produce generation-facing derived relations.

**Annotation-derived relations:**
- `sync_block_method(class, selector, param_index)` — synchronous block API, needs explicit free
- `async_block_method(class, selector, param_index)` — async block, auto-managed
- `stored_block_method(class, selector, param_index)` — stored block (observers, timers)
- `delegate_protocol(protocol)` — protocol suitable for typed delegate builder
- `convenience_error_method(class, selector)` — method with NSError** that can get a result-or-error wrapper
- `collection_iterable(class)` — class with count + objectAtIndex: or NSFastEnumeration
- `scoped_resource(class, open_selector, close_selector)` — begin/end or open/close pairs for `with-` forms
- `main_thread_class(class)` — all methods on this class must be called from main thread

**Verification rules (violations = CI failure):**
- `violation_unwrapped(class, selector)` — id-returning method not wrapped
- `violation_flag_mismatch(class, selector)` — retained flag doesn't match ownership family
- `violation_unclassified_block(class, selector, param_index)` — block param without sync/async classification

**Fact loading:** The enrichment Datalog program loads facts from **two sources**: (1) type-level facts from the annotated checkpoint (which carries forward resolved data — classes, methods, inheritance), and (2) annotation facts (block classifications, ownership, threading, error patterns). Both are in the same `ir/annotated/{Framework}.json` file since each checkpoint is a superset of previous phases.

**`datalog` crate role:** The `datalog` crate is a library that defines shared base relation types, fact-loading utilities, and helper functions used by both `resolve` and `enrich`. Each of `resolve` and `enrich` defines its own `ascent!` program with its own rules, using the `datalog` crate's types for fact representation.

**Process:**
1. Discover all `*.json` in `analysis/ir/annotated/`
2. Load type facts + annotation facts into the enrichment ascent program
3. Run enrichment rules → derived relations
4. Run verification rules → violation report
5. Write `analysis/ir/enriched/{Framework}.json` — fully enriched, ready for Generation
6. Write `analysis/ir/enriched/{Framework}.verification.json` — violation details (if any)

---

## Phase 3: Generation (Outline)

Not the current focus. The Racket emitter moves from the existing POC; all other emitters are new.

**Core principle: idiomatic, not mechanical.** Each emitter produces bindings shaped to its target language's conventions. A Haskell emitter produces monadic APIs with lens-based property access. A Smalltalk emitter produces message-passing objects. A Zig emitter produces explicit allocation with errdefer patterns. The enriched IR carries enough semantic information for emitters to make these decisions automatically.

**Multiple binding styles.** Languages with both OO and functional idioms can produce multiple APIs from the same IR. For example, Common Lisp gets both CLOS class wrappers and a `defun`-based procedural API; OCaml gets both a module-based functional API and an OO API using OCaml's object system. Each style is a separate emitter output, not a compromise between the two.

**Architecture:**
- Reads `analysis/ir/enriched/{Framework}.json`
- Shared emitter framework (`emit` crate) provides common utilities: name mapping, type resolution, documentation rendering, framework dependency ordering
- Per-language emitter crates (`emit-racket`, `emit-haskell`, etc.) implement language-specific code generation
- Each emitter uses enrichment relations (ownership, threading, block lifecycle, error patterns) to decide wrapping patterns
- Runtime support libraries (per-language) provide ObjC object lifecycle management, block/delegate bridging, memory safety guarantees appropriate to the target language
- Swift helper dylibs provide the C-callable ObjC runtime interface shared across all target languages
- Generated documentation cross-references Apple docs using `doc_refs` from collected IR

**Target languages:**

| Language | Binding style(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Racket | OO (classes) + functional | POC exists; port first |
| Chez Scheme | Functional | |
| Gerbil Scheme | OO + functional | |
| Common Lisp (SBCL, CCL) | CLOS + functional | Two implementations, one emitter |
| Haskell | Monadic + lens-based | |
| Idris2 | Dependently-typed wrappers | |
| OCaml | Modules + OO | |
| Prolog / Mercury | Relational | |
| Rhombus | OO (classes) | |
| Pharo Smalltalk | Message-passing OO | |
| Zig | Low-level procedural | |

      "superclass": "NSObject",
      "protocols": ["NSCopying", "NSSecureCoding"],
      "properties": [...],
      "methods": [
        {
          "selector": "initWithString:",
          "class_method": false,
          "init_method": true,
          "params": [

          "deprecated": false,
          "variadic": false,
          "source": "objc_header",
          "provenance": {
            "header": "Foundation/NSString.h",
            "line": 142,
            "availability": {
              "introduced": "10.0",
              "deprecated": null
            }
          },
          "doc_refs": {
            "header_comment": "Returns an NSString object initialized by copying the characters from another given string.",
            "apple_doc_url": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1497402-initwithstring",
            "usr": "c:objc(cs)NSString(im)initWithString:"

    }
  ],
  "protocols": [...],
  "enums": [...],
  "structs": [...],
  "functions": [...],
  "constants": [...],
  "category_methods": [...]
}
```

**Checkpoint composition:** Each successive checkpoint is a **superset** — it carries forward all fields from the previous phase and adds new ones. The enriched checkpoint contains everything from collected + resolved + annotated + enrichment-derived relations. Each checkpoint is self-contained and can be consumed without reading earlier checkpoints.

### Resolved (`analysis/ir/resolved/{Framework}.json`)

Adds to the collected format (all collected fields are preserved):
```json
{
  "format_version": "1.0",
  "checkpoint": "resolved",
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "NSMutableString",
      "ancestors": ["NSString", "NSObject"],
      "effective_methods": [...],
      "effective_properties": [...],
      "returns_retained_selectors": ["init", "initWithString:", "copy", "mutableCopy"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Annotated (`analysis/ir/annotated/{Framework}.json`)

Adds to the resolved format:
```json
{
  "format_version": "1.0",
  "checkpoint": "annotated",
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "NSArray",
      "methods": [
        {
          "selector": "enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:",
          "annotations": {
            "block_parameters": [
              { "param_index": 0, "invocation": "synchronous" }
            ],
            "parameter_ownership": [
              { "param_index": 0, "ownership": "copy" }
            ],
            "source": "llm"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enriched (`analysis/ir/enriched/{Framework}.json`)

Adds to the annotated format:
```json
{
  "format_version": "1.0",
  "checkpoint": "enriched",
  "enrichment": {
    "sync_block_methods": [
      { "class": "NSArray", "selector": "enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:", "param_index": 0 }
    ],
    "delegate_protocols": ["NSWindowDelegate", "NSTableViewDelegate"],
    "convenience_error_methods": [
      { "class": "NSFileManager", "selector": "contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:error:" }
    ],
    "main_thread_classes": ["NSView", "NSWindow", "NSApplication"],
    "collection_iterables": ["NSArray", "NSSet", "NSOrderedSet"]
  },
  "verification": {
    "passed": true,
    "violations": []
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

### Collection
- `clang` crate (libclang Rust wrapper) — ObjC/C header parsing
- `serde`, `serde_json` — IR serialization
- Xcode (provides libclang and swift-api-digester)

### Analysis
- `ascent` — Datalog engine
- `serde`, `serde_json` — checkpoint I/O
- `clap` — CLI argument parsing
- `tracing` — structured logging

### Generation
- `serde`, `serde_json` — enriched checkpoint I/O
- `clap`, `tracing`
- No heavy dependencies (no reqwest, no tokio)

### Swift helpers
- Swift 6.0+ toolchain
- `@_cdecl` for C-callable exports
- macOS 14+ (for Swift runtime libraries)

## What This Design Does Not Cover

- **Windows platform** — separate repo (`APIAnyware-Windows`), COM/WinRT/.NET GC memory model, Roslyn-based collection
- **Linux platform** — separate repo (`APIAnyware-Linux`), GObject/GLib memory model, GIR-based collection
- **Cross-platform shared types** — deferred until a second platform is built and common patterns emerge
- **Bazel build system** — not needed for analysis (pure Rust + scripts); may return for generation phase if multi-toolchain builds are needed
- **Homebrew distribution** — deferred to generation phase completion
